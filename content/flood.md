Dan Hill's [firsthand report of the Brisbane
flood](http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2011/01/flood.html "He's on holiday
there.") weaves a personal story with excursions into history and politics.
His vignettes are plainly told. A wonderful piece of journalism, easy to read,
and something that's brought me closer to these Australian floods (from
halfway around the planet) than anything else. Worth devoting your lunch hour
to. (And it reminds me of nothing so much as John McPhee's _Annals of the
Former World,_ of which you can [read an excerpt
here,](http://www.johnmcphee.com/annalsexec.htm "Also worth a lunch hour!") a
telling of ancient geology via road-trips and stories.)

Also: a [gallery of photos of the Australian
flooding.](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/01/australian_flooding.html "The Big Picture at boston.com") It seems to me not so much a flood as a tiny
but universal shift, as if the world declared a new reality where the water
table is now _here,_ thank you very much, a new matter of fact.
