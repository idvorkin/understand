I've got the latest [Google iPhone app.](http://www.google.com/mobile/iphone/ "Get Google's apps here.") Using it, I took a photo of a [Sudoku
puzzle.](http://www.websudoku.com/ "Billions of puzzles") Google recognised
the puzzle. I tapped again, and it gave me the solution. [See a video
here.](http://singularityhub.com/2011/01/11/google-goggles-uses-your-phone-to-
solve-sudoku-and-more-video/ "Lots of videos of the new Google Goggles app.")

The first time I saw a phone solve Sudoko was an app called [Sudoko
Grab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oImMJ6p6mKE&feature=related "Video.")
[which uses a artificial neural
network.](http://sudokugrab.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-does-it-all-work.html "Blog post explaining how it works.") Wha? Given a picture of the puzzle, the
app turns it into black and white and finds the grid _(computer vision)_ then
overlays the identified numbers over the live video feed _(augmented
reality)._ ~~Then, to solve the puzzle, it uses a toy model of how the brain
works (this is the _artificial neural network_ bit). Just a simple one - it
only needs to do some maths - but it figures out what numbers should go where
so they all obey the rules of the game.~~ A toy model of the brain (the
_artificial neural network_ bit) is used to identify the numbers, and the
puzzle is solved with yer more regular code. (Thanks [Christian

for the correction!)

These's some hard math going on here. Cutting edge technology interests me
only so-so when it's in high-end military tech. And then a little bit more
when it shows up in games and toys (games and toys are automatically
incentivised to pursue new shit, so they're good signals). But it gets super
interesting when it's used for trivial things, but it means that it has become
a commodity that large numbers of people can deploy, and that everyday
platforms are powerful enough to run it. The interesting thing about _Sudoku
Grab_ is that the app is about puzzle solving, not showing off the algorithms,
and that the iPhone - a regular, everyday device, widely deployed (ahem, in a
certain social milieu) - is capable enough to do it. Hard math for trivial
things.
