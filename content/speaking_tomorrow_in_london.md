A reminder: I'm giving a public talk about domestic artificial intelligence,
at 7pm tomorrow (Wednesday 16th), at the Royal Institution in London.

_Botworld: Designing for the new world of domestic A.I._

_Back in the 1960s, we thought the 21st century was going to be about talking
robots, and artificial intelligences we could chat with and play chess with
like people. It didn't happen, and we thought the artificial intelligence
dream was dead._

_But somehow, a different kind of future snuck up on us. One of robot vacuum
cleaners, virtual pets that chat amongst themselves, and web search engines so
clever that we might-as-well call them intelligent. So we got our robots, and
the world is full of them. Not with human intelligence, but with something
simpler and different. And not as colleagues, but as pets and toys._

_Matt looks at life in this Botworld. We'll encounter a zoo of beasts:
telepresence robots, big maths, mirror worlds, and fractional A.I. We'll look
at signals from the future, and try to figure out where it's going._

_We'll look at questions like: what does it mean to relate emotionally to a
silicon thing that pretends to be alive? How do we deal with this shift from
'Meccano' to 'The Sims'? And what are the consequences, when it's not just our
toys and gadgets that have fractional intelligence... but every product and
website?_

_Matt digs into history and sci-fi to find lessons on how to think about and
recognise Botworld, how to design for it, and how to live in it._
