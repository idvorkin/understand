My favourite alternate [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ "Like Facebook
statuses, only that's it.") interface is [isparade.jp.](http://isparade.jp/ "Marching band.") Put in your Twitter name, and your friends come marching
across the screen as stick figures with square heads, speaking their statuses,
[like this,](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebb/5430245855/ "Screenshot.") all
parading after a bigger figure which is me. Also, there's music. Super weird,
super awesome. (Thanks [Matt!)](http://berglondon.com/studio/matt-brown "Matthew Irvine Brown.")

(By the way, if you're on Twitter: follow [@genmon](http://twitter.com/genmon "Yeah, yeah, personal promotion.") for my personal updates, and follow
[@intrcnnctd](http://twitter.com/intrcnnctd "Twitterfeed.com is pretty good!")
to get notified when there's an update to this blog.)
