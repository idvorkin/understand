# Next coffee morning and how to run one

Let’s do coffee morning again! Next week.

**Thursday 29th January, 9.30am for a couple of hours, at the[Book
Club](http://www.wearetbc.com) (100 Leonard St).**

It would be lovely to see you, come along! There’s a vague “making things”
skew, but honestly I’ve spent a lot of time chatting about dogs and music…

We had way too many dudes last time. So if you’re Not A Dude or you bring a
friend who is Not A Dude, I will be extra extra EXTRA pleased to see you.
Please help me fix this.

[Last week’s coffee
morning](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/01/15/coffee_morning) was
bonkers… 15 people, 3 unreleased prototypes from hardware startups, an
emergent theme about how to sell products.
[Other](http://interconnected.org/home/2014/12/19/coffee_morning) coffee
mornings have been more low-key: Six of us talking nonsense and drinking too
much caffeine. I don’t really mind what happens, it’s all good, maybe it’ll
just be me and my laptop next time :)

But seeing as [coffee morning is spreading to San
Francisco](https://twitter.com/obra/status/556895760369737728) I thought it
might be worth writing down what works for me…

If I’m ever in any doubt, I go back and read [what Russell did with his coffee
mornings in 2007.](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/coffee_morning/)
He’s who it all comes from.
