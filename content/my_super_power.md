My super power would be to know the resonant frequency of a thing as soon as
look at it, and have the range of movement in my hands such that I could match
those frequencies.

([Other super powers I would
like.](http://interconnected.org/notes/2006/02/scifi/?p=47 "There are 3. From
the end of the Goldsmith's Sci-fi I Like talk."))

For example I would place my hands on the trunk of a cedar and vibrate my
palms at resonance. It would swing wildly, only gradually at first. At the
opportune time: shove--down it would come. Except that I wouldn't want to.

Bees buzz on the turbulent flow of the air. Fish bumble too, pushing against
and off the whorls emergent in the fluid dynamics of the ocean. They slip
slide in the low pressure gaps the physics leaves.

Perhaps if I could [shiver the surface of my
body](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&uid=5428970&cmd=showdetailview&indexed=google "Chest motion visualized by holographic interferometry. What happens when you
put a woman naked from the waist up on a vibrating platform and make a
hologram of it: you see the isolines of velocity.") correctly and variously, I
could create micro currents and micro vacuums in the air just touching me,
every skin cell tacking into the wind. Then I would swim through them and on
them, like stepping stones, like pinball, like progress and careers and love
and life, like falling upwards.
