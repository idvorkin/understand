[Thai personal names](http://blog.jclark.com/2007/12/thai-personal-names.html "The comments thread is excellent.") include given and family names,
honorifics and nicknames, all of which have different cultural meanings than
how they're used in the UK.

There's also an [alternative way to count your
age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_age_reckoning "You're born at '1'
and this increments at the beginning of every new year.") in China, Korea and
Japan, although this is becoming less popular.
