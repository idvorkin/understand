[So here's what happened today fourteen years
ago](/home/2002/12/12/so_heres_what "Posted back in 2002.") (now twenty years,
two-thirds of a lifetime away). Let's add the other parenthesis: [my first
memory is about brown cows.](http://flickr.com/photos/ebb/3026585681/ "Once
upon a time my family lived in Warwick.") Between those two dates I am strung
taut like a string on a violin, and my original note played; my harmonics and
tones since then emerging, recombining, gaining texture, depth and power;
resonating and causing resonance, folding in and over, unique rhythms and
vibrations arising and overlaying, until now when I have become a full, rich,
individual note. But the pure, simple first harmonic is present still and -
the entire stretch of my memory of him - those seven years are deep inside me,
my spine, valuable, and appreciated.
