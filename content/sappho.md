# Midnight Poem by Sappho

Tonight I’ve watched

The moon and then  
the Pleiades  
go down

The night is now  
half-gone; youth  
goes; I am

in bed alone

I don’t know much - really anything - by or about Sappho. Except this, a
fragment of the Midnight Poem, and in particular this translation by Mary
Barnard, which was the subject of a [blog post by Clive Thompson from
2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20190103160912/http://clivethompson.net/2016/05/16/astronomers-
crack-the-secret-of-this-gorgeous-poem-by-sappho/) (that link to Internet
Archive): "In a mere eight lines, she paints the melancholy of middle age onto
the canvas of the night sky."

It’s beautiful. The blog post is only available in the Archive now, and the
translation isn’t available online except as [a
photograph](https://www.instagram.com/p/wj0Rc5pdH_/) which is a broken image
in that blog post, so I’ve transcribed it here so I’ve got it to come back to.

In that post, Thompson describes a recently published astronomy paper:

The Pleiades (which is that tight box of stars which I recognise but I’m
rubbish at names; by Aldebaran) - says the paper - were visible, in 570 BC
around the time the poem was written, at the appointed time which is before
midnight, between 25 January and 5 April.

I can imagine how I feel at that time of night, at that time of year. No
artificial light of course, or not much anyway. No stultifying heat. I haven’t
slept yet, so it’s not in that witching hour before second sleep. But I’m
awake and gazing at the sky, long enough that I can see the stars move.

It brings me closer to Sappho. The eyes of science as an empathy machine.
