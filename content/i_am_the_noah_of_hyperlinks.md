I am the Noah of hyperlinks.

Products or services that include mental well-being as a feature:

The [World Stress Map](http://www-wsm.physik.uni-
karlsruhe.de/pub/introduction/introduction_frame.html "A whole other kind of
stress.") shows the boundaries of the tectonic plates. The Pacific plate is
large, and the western Pacific a whole load more textured than I expected. All
those drowned continents.

Games about something that are actually about something else:

_(I love the world and the world loves me.)_

[I've called this "body-thinking" before](/notes/2006/07/engaging/?p=28 "A
presentation on Engaging Technology, talking about Project Rub for the
Nintendo DS."): the kind of reading of the world we do non-mentally.
Everything we do taps into different motivations, of course (the joy of
[watching things happen](http://www.popcap.com/games/peggle "At least to begin
with, that's what makes it so addictive."); the joy of [putting things away
neatly](http://schulzeandwebb.com/2007/hills/slides/?p=37 "Modern sports are
all about tidying up."); plain old needing to), but Audiosurf and Endorfun
seem different somehow: the ostensible aim of the game is really just an
excuse to keep you busy while the real mental pay-off happens.

_(I create joyous relationships.)_

On the study of the natural laws of exceptions,

research library."):

And:

Two by two! Two by two!
