Some lines that stuck with me from Berger:

The animal scrutinizes him across a narrow abyss of non-comprehension.

an animal’s life, never to be confused with a man’s, can be seen to run
parallel to his. Only in death do the two parallel lines converge and after
death, perhaps, cross over to become parallel again

As I say, I’m no scientist, but I have the impression that scientists today,
when dealing with phenomena whose time or spatial scale is either immense or
very small … are on the point of breaking through space-time to discover
another axis on which events may be strung

Some lines that got me in McPhee, the first about the Colorado river, the
second on Lake Powell:

he quoted Edith Warner: “‘This is a day when life and the world seem to be
standing still – only time and the river flowing past the mesas.’“

The Utah canyonland had been severed halfway up by a blue geometric plane,
creating a waterscape of interrupted shapes, spectacularly unnatural,
spectacularly beautiful.

I can’t help myself but point my finger at these conjunctions. Narrow Abyss.
Discover Another Axis. Interrupted Shapes.

By date finished in May:

Look, there are two sequences in _Wild Life_ which the narrator Charlotte
Bridger Drummond spends in silence – one in the forest and one in the company
of other people. And nobody but nobody writes about silence better than Gloss.
_The Dazzle of the Day_ \- her science fiction novel about starships and
Quakers - puts silence (and in this case spirituality) right at the centre.
You can look through silence, see what is refracted through it, and you can
look around it, and it has heft and volume, and many many hues. But it’s
invisible. It’s where things are born, or where you can become trapped. It’s
animal, outside language. But the other way too, it’s where god speaks.

Anyway. I’m in the library. A week or two back I was hiking in the mountains.

_Book from the Ground_ is a graphic novel told with emoji.
