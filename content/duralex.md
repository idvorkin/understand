I buy my home glassware from a French company called _Duralex._ In particular
the [Duralex Picardie tumblers.](http://www.duralexusa.com/Picardie-Tumblers-
cat1.html?parentId=0&pushParent "US distributor.") The Picardie is a design
classic, good for wine, coffee, scotch and water. They remind me of holidays
to the south of France, and of primary school. The company has been [in and
out of receivership these past few years](http://www.le-tom.com/duralex "A
little history.") so I have a couple boxes spare I bought on eBay. I'm pleased
to hear that [Duralex is in safe hands once
again.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/duralex-ndash-the-
glass-tumbler-that-would-not-be-broken-1879993.html "Article from this time
last year.") Not mine though. The glass is toughened, the tumblers are
supposed to be almost unbreakable. But I smashed one into ten thousand tiny
pieces over the weekend. Whoops!
