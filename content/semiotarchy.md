# We live in a semiotarchy

Our street seems to have become a waiting point for ride-share drivers between
jobs. We’re haunted by black saloon cars, parked up with motors idling,
drivers tapping their apps.

Separately, our street is periodically used as a route for large trucks and
coaches – which then either get stuck going round the corner at one end, and
have to reverse back all the way; or at the corner on the other end, go
straight over a bollard and leave debris everywhere. I don’t know whether this
is an occasional mislabelling of our street as a phantom major road, or
ripples from roadworks a mile away fooling the routing algorithms.

Data in the mirror world is making it noisy outside my house. The map is
intruding on the territory.

It’s contested. Los Angeles is a city of need-to-know neighbourhood shortcuts
being revealed by _Waze,_ the pro Google Maps:

The Waze algorithms don’t care about the societal cost they inflict and
neither does Waze if the algorithm calculates that a cut-through may save
seconds. “The instant the time penalties work out,” DwarfLord claims, “Waze
will just as happily send a thousand Wazers down a Passageway as it would [a
single] one.”

Local residents attempt to wrest control of the map. Anyone can make
suggestions to the Waze, and so, to solve this particular problem, a Level 3
community editor "suggests setting a segment at each end of a tiny road as
“unpaved.” Or marking it as a “gated community.”"

I suggest that we have entered a **semiotarchy** – like an oligarchy or a
plutarchy, only our era is the tyranny of signs.
