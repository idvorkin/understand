#3books. [I asked people on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/genmon/statuses/848500163 "Using Twitter as a
chatroom, sorry folks."), earlier today, to share the 3 most recent books
they've read. [Here are mine](http://twitter.com/genmon/statuses/848500571 "Or
you could just read the blog post adjacent to this."); you can join in by
adding '#3books' to your message. The responses are brilliant: you can read
them at both [at Summize](http://summize.com/search?q=%233books "#3books at
Summize.") and [at Twemes](http://twemes.com/3books "#3books at twemes")
(neither site gets the full collection unfortunately). Thanks all for playing!
That's my reading list for the next 6 months sorted out.
