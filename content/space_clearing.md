[Roll up your sleeves and do the
following:](http://fengshui.about.com/od/fengshuispaceclearing/ht/feng-shui-
space-clearing-major.htm "'How To Do a Major Feng Shui Space Clearing
Session'") "starting at the main door and moving clockwise, clap strongly into
each corner of your house. Clap from the lowest level to as high as you can
reach to the ceiling. You will feel a huge difference in the quality of energy
as the sound of clapping will be different depending on the accumulated
energy. Be sure not to omit any corners in your house, and be sure to clap as
much as necessary; some house corners will require more time." (This is a
technique called _space clearing.)_

_City_

The [Situationists](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/bps/SI/preface.htm "Political/artistic movement begun in France, 1950/60s.") adopted the
technique of the
[dérive,](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.evans/psychogeog.html "Situationists and psychogeography.") to drift through the city without a goal
and "notice the way in which certain areas, streets, or buildings resonate
with states of mind, inclinations, and desires, and to seek out reasons for
movement other than those for which an environment was designed."

I used to spend my lunch breaks in London taking constrained walks following
simple algorithms: first right, first left, repeat. (Or: second left, second
left, first right, repeat.) I found myself on familiar roads, turning down
side-streets I'd never noticed before. Thinking about why, I found that the
architecture of the city, when I stood at a particular spot or walked in a
particular way, would bend my attention towards some places and away from
others. All it takes is a gentle curve to the right and a busy junction at the
end, and the street in shadow to my left is unobserved and never taken. Every
day. And then the habit is formed, and so, to me, it's as if the side-street
never existed. And if everyone who walks down the street has the same
experience, then the side-street is ignored and the main street is bustling
and new shops open, and so positive feedback occurs that locks the city into
this form. The psychogeography reinforces itself.

Constrained walks and the dérive both reveal the city's psychogeography, and
force the city to give up more of itself. It's funny to find, right on my
doorstep, the streets I didn't know that I didn't know, the ones I'd got the
unknown habit of avoiding. The city grows.

_Home_

Space clearing makes visible and disrupts the psychogeography of my home. By
standing in far corners, I find new perspectives. I strengthen rarely visited
spots in my own mental map. Later, I find myself noticing the corners more. My
house looks larger. The changed shape of my rooms encourages me to walk
differently about the space. I stand in slightly unfamiliar spots, look at my
bookshelves with a new-found unfamiliarity, and this prompts new combinations
of titles to come to my attention, and new ideas.

I wonder if I could make something to do this for me? Maybe a [robot vacuum
cleaner](http://gizmodo.com/5246099/long+exposure-shot-of-a-roombas-path-
shows-beautifully-organized-chaos "Long exposure photo of a Roomba's path
round a home.") programmed to find rarely visited corners and play an
attention-grabbing sample, _hey, over here, over here._
