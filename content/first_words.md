# Various first words

The [first words sent by
tachygraphe](http://interconnected.org/notes/2006/02/scifi/?p=23) (optical
telegraph, or Chappe telegraph), by Claude Chappe, 1791: "If you succeed, you
will bask in glory."

The [first words sent by electrical
telegraph](http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/reform/jb_reform_morsecod_1.html),
by Samuel Morse, 1844: "What hath God wrought!" – however, this was the first
telegraph using the repeater system. The actual first message, on the
demonstration system, was sent with no repeaters, for just 2 miles, and was
_received_ by Samuel Morse but was _sent_ [by Alfred Vail in
1838](https://www.inventionandtech.com/landmark_landing/80518): "A patient
waiter is no loser."

The [first words spoken on the
telephone](https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0404/digitize.html), by Alexander
Graham Bell, 1876: "Mr. Watson – Come here – I want to see you."

The [first characters sent on ARPANET](https://www.icann.org/news/blog/the-
first-message-transmission), the predecessor to the internet, by Charley
Kline, 1969: "lo" – for “login,” but it crashed.

The [first words sent by text message
(SMS)](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568393428/the-first-text-messages-
celebrates-25-years), by Neil Papworth, 1992: "merry Christmas"

Here’s a good one, from [this BBC article on various first
words](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12784072). The first words spoken
on YouTube, 2005: "Alright, so here we are in front of the elephants."

Related: [fictional first words spoken on
Mars](https://spacearchaeology.org/?p=319), a list. The one I always remember
is from _Red Mars_ by Kim Stanley Robinson, the words of John Boone, 2020:
"Well, here we are."

Strangely similar to YouTube. Though no elephants.
