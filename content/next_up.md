Next up: I've been to O'Reilly ETech since [ETech
2002](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon2002/ "Previously called P2P. The
bags had the new logo overprinted on last year's P2P one."), and was planning
to have 2008 off. But then I saw [the
sessions](http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/topic/General "ETech
2008 general sessions."): [tangible internet
objects](http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/1339 "The PC-free
Internet, David Rose (Ambient Devices)"), [the brain and
society](http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/1551 "Use Your
Head: The Future of Mind Hacks, panel."), [activity-based

Socializers, and Producers: How Internet Technologies are Changing Our View of
Ourselves, Elizabeth Churchill (Yahoo! Research)"),

So I'm going, it looks to awesome to skip. See you in [San
Diego](http://wikitravel.org/en/San_Diego "WikiTravel page as I can't link to
dopplr.com unless you're also a member.")! Drop me a line if you fancy a beer.

I'm canyoning first for a few days in Arizona.

Also coming up: I'm keynoting at [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org/ "This is
still the 2007 site, but that's change."), the GNOME Users' And Developers'
European Conference, in Istanbul in July. Not my usual turf I have to admit,
but the brief grabbed me--I've been asked to speak "about what you see the
future of software being - desktop vs web app vs hybrid - and of course the
kinds of things that you have on your mind which led to Mind Hacks." And how
could I turn that down? I'm a sucker for a good topic.
