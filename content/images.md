# Experimental images

Here’s an image plucked from latent space.

I’ve been doing a little work with [Glif](https://glif.app) – think: tiny,
shareable AI workflows for playful creation.

So of course I’ve been playing with the glifs (the workflows) that people have
already shared.

One is [Create Website](https://glif.app/glifs/clvhywzuq0000nvp9ri14d7sj). I
gave it a prompt like:

think of a cool piece of animated, generative art to make with p5.js. start by
importing the library using url URL
https://cdn.jsdelivzr.net/npm/p5@1.9.3/lib/p5.js and then write code to update
a canvas with your art. don’t include any other words or headings, just a full
page canvas. make the art responsive to something such as the cursor position

([p5.js](https://p5js.org) is a Javascript library for generative art.)

And the results were… gorgeous?

These are screenshots of single-page animated websites.

I am kinda intrigued about this kind of emergent aesthetic?

The market trend of AI tools is domestication. Early days, AI art was wild –
[squirrels made of puppy slugs](/home/2015/06/19/filtered). Now it’s like what
a person would do only cheaper? Words too are vacuous, expected.

Creativity is dismissed as “hallucination.”

So when I find a way to bypass the training with a short prompt and get this
raw energy… we’re looking into the soul of the weights. We’re orbiting around
sparse feature attractors that represent the actual creative output of
humanity. Stripped of corporate RLFH it actually means something to do a
Straussian reading of the output tokens, we’re as close as we’ll ever be to
dowsing the collective unconscious.

Anyway. I don’t often put images on my blog, mainly because I wrote the code
myself with the goal of it being as simple as possible.

But I’d like to have images _sometimes._

Which means I need a quick test to ensure they show up in
[email](https://eepurl.com/befEuL),
[RSS](https://interconnected.org/home/feed), on small screens etc.

This post is that test.
