When we make the breakthrough that means humans can speak with dolphins, what
should our first 20 questions be? [Here's a
list.](http://www.speakdolphin.com/20questions.cfm "20 questions to ask
dolphins.") It's an interesting thought experiment!

The [United Nations Office for Outer Space
Affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNOOSA "UNOOSA") is the forum for
developing [principles on the use of
space.](http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/treaties.html "Treaties.") I
wonder if they have a list of first questions in the event that an alien
species turn up.

I'd like to be able to speak to pets and farm animals. Dolphin and squid might
be our aquatic doppels, but it's a fascinating and terrifying idea that we
might have to develop a sociology of cattle or sheep, and negotiate with them
(and ourselves) their lives, comfort, and death. To be fair, we probably
already communicate with them enough for _that_ particular conversation.
