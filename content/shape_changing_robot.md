[Fits.me](http://fits.me/ "Boring website for an awesome robot.") (strap:
"Virtual Fitting Room for Online Clothes Retailers") has a shape-changing
robot mannequin hooked up to a webcam.
[Deets:](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20018094-1.html?tag=mncol;txt "CNet write-up.") "Customers shopping at a participating site enter their body
measurements online (height, chest, arm length, torso, type, and so on), then
see photos of a mannequin shaped just like them 'trying on' the item they're
eyeing in different sizes and styles."

[Great photos here.](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662372/fitsmes-shape-
shifting-robot-lets-you-try-on-clothes-online-video "Fast Company write-up.")
And also, this quote from the CEO: "Now, we have a robot that can be any shape
at the push of a button. I wish I had a button like that." WHOA.

Superpowers suddenly seem more of-our-world if they have buttons. What if Mr.
Fantastic had to press a button before he stretched? What if Superman had one
button to fly, one button to use his heat rays, and another button to fly or
use his super speed? Villains would try to press them! He would fumble for
them in a rush! What if the Iron Man suit ran on Windows 3.1, and the mouse
ball kept sticking? What if Superman lost his user-defined preferences file
and his only back-up was at the back of a drawer in the Fortress of Solitude?
