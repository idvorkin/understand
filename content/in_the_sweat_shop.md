In the Sweat-Shop: I ran across this excerpt in Heim's biography of John von
Neumann and Norbert Wiener. It's the first stanza "In the Sweat-Shop," from
Leo Wiener's translation of the Yiddish poems of Morris Rosenfeld.

_The machines in the shop roar so wildly that  
often I forget in the roar that I am; I am  
lost in the terrible tumult, my ego disappears, I  
am a machine. I work, and work, and work with-  
out end; I am busy, and busy, and busy at all time.  
For what? and for whom? I know not, I ask not!  
How should a machine ever come to think? _

It reminds me how the processes that surround us drown and re-cut us.

The collection is online: [Songs from the
ghetto](http://www.archive.org/details/songsfromghettow00roseuoft "Norbert
Wiener's father translated.") (1898).
