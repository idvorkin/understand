# Zizek’s view on The Sound of Music

This is a tough but intriguing one: _The Sound of Music_ is ostensibly a movie
about homely Austrians resisting the invading fascists.

But [Slavoj Zizek explains that it is also a pro-fascist
movie](http://www.critical-theory.com/watch-zizek-explain-why-the-sound-of-
music-is-fucked/).

Zizek’s argument: the heroes of the movie are these anti-intellectual
Austrians who are living a traditional life, i.e. rejecting change. Therefore
they have a fascistic quality. _Whereas_ the type Nazis shown not soldiers but
urbane cosmopolitans, precisely the elite class that (populist) fascists want
to eliminate.

So while the surface narrative is about beating the Nazis, the underlying
message has us rooting for a fascistic mindset.

It’s… a stretch. If true then maybe that’s why the movie continues to feel so
fresh: because it runs counter to our expectations every time.

But I enjoy being challenged to think about things like this, especially a
film that I’ve seen so many times.

The meta here, I suppose, is that we all have a fascistic tendency and that’s
why the traditional Austrian life appeals: the desire to resist change, and to
exert control on others and the world. Sometimes that’s unhealthy (I mean,
_clearly_ when it comes to Nazis, but also authoritarianism in general, and
also when it is generally unwarranted and connected with fury when the world -
understandably - doesn’t immediately accord to one’s whim). But sometimes it
is fine: gardening, parenting, management, design, all forms of control that
are generally a-o.k… though I imagine we can all recall examples where even
these have become over-controlling. And so the line must be policed.
