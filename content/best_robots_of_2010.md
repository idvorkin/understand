[A review of the best robots of
2010:](http://singularityhub.com/2011/01/04/a-review-of-the-best-robots-
of-2010/ "Pictures and text.") balance, telepresence (it would be seriously
creepy to replace Skype with [a squirming robot
fetus,](http://singularityhub.com/2010/10/18/telenoid-the-creepiest-
telepresence-robot-youll-ever-love-video/ "Yuck.") but that's the future),
robot cars, flying things (sadly nothing as beautiful as the [robot air
penguins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPGgl5VH5go "Graceful.")), puzzle
solving robot hands, and tree climbers.
