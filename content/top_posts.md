# My most popular posts in 2022 and other lists

This is simultaneously the wrap-up post for 2022 and also the _“Start here”_
post for new readers. Hello! You’ll find stats here and lots of links.

Often my personal faves don’t make the popular list. I’ve collected my
**favourite, most speculative** posts, on topics like

_(Some posts have extra tags. Please do go spelunking if a topic catches your
eye. Dolphins seem to come up a bunch.)_

More starting points!

So I’m coming up to three years of this _“voice”_ – this frequency, these

practice; my imagination happens in my fingers, and I figure things out by
writing them down.

Thanks for reading. I appreciate you being here.
