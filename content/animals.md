# Animals driving cars and other jobs

Perhaps more animals should go to work. Here are three examples of animals
driving cars:

I’m reminded of this 2017 design concept to [train crows to pick up litter in
cities](https://www.designboom.com/technology/crowded-cities-crows-cigarette-
butts-10-07-2017/). Cleverly, the crows don’t need to be trained directly.
Instead this concept imagines installing a **crowbar:** "a smart machine
training crows to pick up cigarette butts from the street."

Check out [CrowBox](http://www.thecrowbox.com) if you want to try this on your
own street. It’s an open source hardware design, "an experimentation platform
designed to autonomously train corvids (the family of birds crows belong to).
So far we’ve trained captive crows to deposit dropped coins they found on the
ground in exchange for peanuts."

We’re accustomed to animals working in agriculture: sheep dogs, oxen to lend
their strength to the plough, chickens according to their nature. So why not
in the industrialised sphere too?

One ethical concern is that animal employees, as we can see in agro-industry,
would be driven too hard and mistreated in the name of efficiency and business
economics. But it strikes me that this is more of a complaint about capitalism
than the ethics of animals having jobs.

Surely the answer to animals potentially being over-worked is to find a way
for them to unionise.

Who could speak for collies driving Ubers? Or give a voice to ferrets
scampering along shelves and piloting forklifts in Amazon warehouses?

It’s not like these roles are given much representation today, with people
doing them. So maybe the real value of [dolphins](/home/2020/07/20/dolphins)
driving delivery drones would be to show us the path to fair worker treatment
for all, humans and nonhumans alike.
