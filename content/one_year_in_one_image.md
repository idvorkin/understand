[One year in one image,](http://eirikso.com/2011/01/04/one-year-in-one-image/ "You can click to make it bigger. Forest scene.") by Eirik Solheim [thanks
[Timo](http://www.elasticspace.com/ "Timo Arnall sent the link round to the
studio list.")]. This is a gorgeous, a time lapse pixel sliced photograph of a
forest. It's funny to see how fast the seasons transition. It's like winter,
winter, winter, winter, then boom, spring. Then spring is like watching
something catch fire. It imperceptibly greens, a raising of temperature, a
growing [veriditas](http://www.brodeck.de/redmars/culture_and_religion.htm "'the greening fructiparous power'") or
[orenda](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431779/orenda "Iroquiois
(North American) term for power, particularly life power.") that suddenly
ignites. I wonder how much this varying rate of change influences my _own_
perception of time passing: January to July 2010 lasted ten centuries, but the
second half of the year flashed by in a second.
