[Majesty 2, the Fantasy Kingdom
Sim:](http://www.vpltd.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=261 "I
haven't played this.") "In the world of Majesty, you are the ruler of the
kingdom Ardania. At your service are your loyal and somewhat obnoxious
subordinates, who have their own minds about how things should be done. In
fact, Majesty is the only game where _your heroes decide on their own what
should be done and when, leaving you to try to control them through monetary
incentives._"

See also [Godville,](http://godvillegame.com/ "Browser and iPhone games")
available for iPhone, in which your hero collects items, has fights, embarks
on quests, advances through levels, and keeps a diary... and you do nothing
but watch (and occasionally give encouragement.)
