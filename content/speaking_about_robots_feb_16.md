I've been exploring themes around [artificial
intelligence,](http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/08/ai_revolution "Fractional A.I.") [telepresence
robots,](http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/19/telepresence_robots "A
collection.") and
[Furbys](http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/28/furby_and_the_fourth_kingdom "The fourth kingdom of nature!") recently. In a sort of fun, figuring-it-out,
what do we need to know, how to design for it and live in it kind of way. I'm
enjoying myself.

And... I'm giving an evening lecture about it all on Wednesday 16th February,
at 7pm. The title:

_Botworld: Designing for the new world of domestic A.I._

It's at the Royal Institution in London.

You should come! But you'll need to book. [Read more about
