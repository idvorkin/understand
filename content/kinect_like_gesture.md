[Kinect-Like Gesture System for iPad to Be Demoed at
CES](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/12/22/kinect-like-gesture-system-for-ipad-
to-be-demoed-at-ces/ "At MacRumors.") (includes video). The product is
[Mimesign from Elipticllabs:](http://www.ellipticlabs.com/products/ "Oslo
technology and interaction design company.") "When interacting with a toy or a
gadget, the user shouldnâ€™t have to change her state of mind. Rather than
entering a mindset where high precision is required to locate the right button
or icon, Mimesign seeks to create a different and more natural bond between
the user and the device."

In the future we will interact with _all_ our devices by doing tiny techno
dancing at them.
