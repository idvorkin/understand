# Four years of noting down my favourite words

Feel free to skip reading this post. It’s just a big list of words and
phrases, here so I don’t lose it.

On 27 February 2017, about four years ago, I [tweeted these
words](https://twitter.com/genmon/status/836316538609217536): "Storm Doris.
Mimecom. Cloudbleed. Athleisure. Cromwell. H7N9. Trappist-1"

In order, they are: _a serious storm that was hitting the UK; the virtual
reality technology in the the 1993 sci-fi TV miniseries[Wild
Palms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Palms); a major security hole
discovered in a particular and widely-used content delivery network; a still
fast-growing and newly mainstream fashion trend; the winner of the First
English Civil War and only republican leader of the Commonwealth; a then-
common bird flu subtype; a star only [40 light years
away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1) which had just been discovered
to have four previously unknown terrestrial exoplanets._

I like words, and I note down ones that catch my eye as we cross paths. I have
a little file, and once I have another seven or eight, I’ve been posting them
as replies to that original tweet. [Here’s the most recent
one](https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1362896887775449088) (19 Feb 2021).

I tend to record words that…

Sometimes I read over the list, random access style, just to remind myself of
forgotten thoughts. Each word is a bookmark into a little cascade of concepts
in my brain.

So because I’d like to keep these words somewhere I can find them in the
future, I’m putting them here.

Thanks for your attention and I’m happy to take any questions.
