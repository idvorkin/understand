New presentation online. I've put up the slides and notes for **Movement**
(from [my WDN08 trip](/home/2008/02/04/best_conference_ever "Conferences that
*just work* are surprisingly rare.")). [Read Movement
here.](http://schulzeandwebb.com/2008/movement/)

A key introduction in the talk is **Snap** , a pattern for syndicating
interactions. I've been working on this with [Tom
Armitage](http://infovore.org/ "Who seems to be a hacking mission right
now."), and he's built the proof of concept. For more on that, and a longer
essay about Snap outside the presentation itself, [read about
Snap](http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2008/02/06/snap/ "Bloody hell that's
long. It could've been the talk itself.") on the company weblog.
