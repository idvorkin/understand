# Vincent van Gogh on the stars

[Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh Arles, c. 9 July
1888:](http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/506.htm?qp=health.impotence)

That brings up again the eternal question: is life completely visible to us,
or isn’t it rather that this side of death we see one hemisphere only?

And:

For my own part, I declare I know nothing whatever about it. But to look at
the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots of a
map representing towns and villages. Why, I ask myself, should the shining
dots of the sky not be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?
If we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a
star. One thing undoubtedly true in this reasoning is this: that while we are
alive we cannot get to a star, any more than when we are dead we can take the
train.

So it doesn’t seem impossible to me that cholera, gravel, pleurisy & cancer
are the means of celestial locomotion, just as steam-boats, omnibuses and
railways are the terrestrial means. To die quietly of old age would be to go
there on foot.

Which, to me, puts his [Starry
Night](http://blog.wolfram.com/2014/12/01/extending-van-goghs-starry-night-
with-inpainting/) on a bigger canvas than it had before.
