# Let’s invent new interfaces, not new products

Okay, so how about a pager with an AI in it?

In some ways the last few years have been inventive for consumer tech: smart
watches, smart speakers, car dashboards, and smart glasses almost inevitably
just over the horizon.

But take the watch: I feel like it suffers from being jammed through the same
app-based interaction paradigm that was perfected on the smartphone, which
itself was a simplified version of the desktop UI.

I don’t think we need to look _far_ for alternate interaction paradigms.

All of those!

Yet… we’re stuck with apps?

I don’t know, it just feels like we might be missing a trick.

What if the goal was to come up with whole new ways of interacting?

You could play a game:

I think that would take you somewhere new.

Like maybe such an interaction mode would slipstream directly into the
internal monologue. You’d mumble to yourself “I think I’ll spend the next hour
writing,” and a buzz at your waist would make you look at the screen: _No
sorry you have a call in 30 minutes._

Or you would say, under your breath: “I’m heading into town now” – and the
buzz would only come if it picked up that your usual train was delayed or
whatever.

Or you would rapid-fire scan the headlines and triage your email, muttering
quietly as you go through, with your phone by your side to pick up bigger
tasks. What sophisticated data structures could you manipulate? If our
primitives in the current world are basically apps, scrollable canvases,
lists, form widgets, and tapping, and in the desktop world were windows,
documents, and menus, what would they be for this?

I’ve been using dictation as an alternative to the keyboard on my iPad
recently, and I feel like multimodal text+voice is under-explored right now,
and more powerful than voice on its own.
