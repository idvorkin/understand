# What’s new on Machine Supply

Okay! So since I first tweeted about Machine Supply 48 hours ago, there have
been 46 books recommended by people-who-aren’t-me! In case you missed it,
[here’s where I explain what Machine Supply
is.](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/07/22/machine_supply)

And, for example, [here’s my recommendation for Wild
Life.](http://machine.supply/books/genmon/34)

I have also earned Amazon affiliate fees totalling - drumroll - $3.30.

To celebrate I’ve added a simple way to see new recommendations – once you’re
signed in, there’s a “What’s new” page which lists the 15 most recent.

tbh I’m not totally happy with the functionality, but it’ll do as a start.
