Books read December 2008, with date finished:

I've also read a few sci-fi novellas using Stanza on my phone (One-Shot, James
Blish; Invaders from the Infinite, John Campbell; The Colors of Space, Marion
Zimmer Bradley) but for some reason, being texts and not books made out of
paper, I don't feel they belong here. I am capricious with my list of books
read.

I'm not feeling too wordy today, so let's keep it brief.

The Holocene: scale, the big picture like _Annals of the Former World_ (read
May this year), nature and culture as a single thing, the tortuous paths of
cause and contingency, the planets and its natureculture and geological
structures and histories as metaphor mines: the planet as self.

Hollings: a collage mixing facts and facts of fiction, a portrait of post-war
America (it's my favourite period), the back-drop to cybernetics, flying
saucers and suburbia.

A Humument: a text found in the pages of the novel _A Human Document_ , each
page a painting, a play between text where we are trained to silently ignore
everything but the encoded information, and the visual surface where every
position, colour, reference, juxtaposition, quality is important, and to
ricochet between these two. Poetry.

You should read _Welcome to Mars,_ def.
