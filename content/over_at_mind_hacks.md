My favourite is the [ambient panic
video](http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2008/01/dreamy_panic_mashup.html "Panic!
At the mid-century suburban society home!"), overlaying dreamy suburban
visuals on [this radio documentary about panic (All In The
Mind)](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/allinthemind/stories/2007/2105424.htm "They

Curtis](http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/12/22/212041/57/454/425671 "Curtis' documentaries are the future.") meets [Lucid
Dreams](http://www.sleepbot.com/ambience/album/lucid.html "Have you noticed
nobody ever talks about the *content* of their lucid dreams? It's because
they're too damn dirty to say out loud.").
