From this list of [6 Tiny Things That Have Mind-Blowing Global
Impacts](http://www.cracked.com/article_18403_6-tiny-things-that-have-mind-
blowing-global-impacts*p2.html "It's funny but it's true") I discover that
"every living thing in the ocean combines to move enough water to stir things
up as much as the moon and wind." More info at this article: [Jellyfish Are
the Dark Energy of the
Oceans.](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/jellyfish/ "Wired
article.") Basic story goes like this: scientists were trying to figure out
where ripples and movements of the ocean come from. The moon is an obvious
one, as is the wind. And they assumed that all the movements of fish and krill
and whatnot would cancel out. But no -- the effects of all these tiny living
things add up to about the same as the pull of gravity of the one great big
moon. That's a lovely metaphor for \_something,* I'm sure.

Another good fact: "most of the ocean - excepting the top 300 feet or so - is
so placid that a couple hand-held kitchen mixers could stir a cubic mile of
it."
