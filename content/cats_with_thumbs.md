It feels true! But I wonder. Every so often I think about whether cats are
Good or Evil. And last time I gave it much thought, I concluded that they
don't have [original sin.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin "These
Wikipedia articles are actually pretty good you know.") There is no eternal
stain on the soul of cats, and therefore nothing against which they can be
measured. They are without Heaven or Hell, they can be neither Good nor Evil
(it is only we who interpret their actions one way or the other). Anyway,
