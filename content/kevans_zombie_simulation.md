[Kevan's zombie simulation](http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/ "The
original. Old but excellent.") reminds me of nothing so much as the formation
of galaxies. As the sim starts, the universe is hot and young. The survivors
get infected and condense into slower moving matter, which then itself clumps
into larger, even slower moving massive objects. [Galaxies are zombie hordes
of stars](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/ "Image from 1996. Well, image from between some millions and 10 billion or
years ago, depending on the distance of each galaxy."), shuffling round the
universe converting the free interstellar medium into brainless eating
machines.
