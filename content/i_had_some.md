I had some recommendations for more [seminal texts in
computing](/home/2007/09/18/a_bunch_of_texts "As discussed the other day, here
on Interconnected."):

Thanks all; loads of reading there. Now I can't find the email - maybe it was
IM - but [Tom Armitage](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Turing-Jack-
Copeland/dp/0198250800 "Who is very generous, letting us interrupt his date
night with drinking.") mentioned [The Essential
Turing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Turing-Jack-Copeland/dp/0198250800 "Hard. Core.") to me. Man, that looks like it's right to the heart of the
matter. Maybe I should read it to warm up to [Feynmann's Lectures on
Physics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lectures-Physics-Complete-
Set-1-3/dp/0201021153/ "I am ashamed I've not read these already.").
