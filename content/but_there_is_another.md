"But there is another aspect of love, which some may also have experienced,
and which is likewise illustrated in a Persian text. This one is from an
ancient Zoroastrian legend of the first parents of the human race, where they
are pictured as having sprung from the earth in the form of a single reed, so
closely joined that they could not have been told apart. However, in time they
separated; and again in time they united, and there were born to them two
children, who they loved so tenderly and irresistibly that they ate them up.
The mother ate one; the father ate the other; and God, to protect the human
race, then reduced the force of man's capacity for love by some ninety-nine
per cent. Those first parents thereafter had seven more pairs of children,
every one of which, however--thank God!--survived."
