[Processing monsters](http://rmx.cz/monsters/ "Tiny interactive monsters.") is
a collection of little interactive monsters made with
[Processing,](http://processing.org/ "Processing is neat. Or rather, the
tutorials around it and the environment is super accessible.") the computer
language for easily making images and animations.

The monsters are super cute. The scratchy black and white aesthetic is weirdly
alive in this age of smooth gradients and drop-shadows. I like the grit.
