I'd like to finish reading another 12 books before the end of 2007, as this
would take me to 2/week over the year. I'm a few pages from the end of _The
Art of Innovation_ (Tom Kelley), and the following 5 books are in the queue:
_The Great Gatsby_ (F. Scott Fitzgerald); _The Fabric of Reality_ (David
Deutsch); _The Catcher in the Rye_ (J. D. Salinger); _Programming Collective
Intelligence_ (Toby Segaran); _Pedagogical Sketchbook_ (Paul Klee). A possible
is _The Nature and Art of Workmanship_ (David Pye).

I need to find another 5 books.

There are two constraints: I'm reading at 50% above my usual pace in order to
reach the target, so I need to avoid the books that take me a while longer
than usual to get through (_Consuming Life_ (Zygmunt Bauman), I'm looking at
you). However I don't want to cheat by reading pulp sci-fi, so I would like a
few more non-fiction books in there, especially because my fiction consumption
has been pretty high these last couple of months.

Any suggestions?

(More data: my quest for [seminal computing texts](/home/2007/09/20/i_had_some "Recommendations.") led to me reading _The Pattern on the Stone_ (W Daniel
Hillis) and _Platform for Change_ (Stafford Beer). And this is [what I said
about books in 2005](/home/2005/06/02/tom_coates_passed_me "My favourite
books.")... which reminds me that I haven't read _The Rubaiyyat_ (Omar
Khayaam) recently, so that may also have to drop onto the stack.)
