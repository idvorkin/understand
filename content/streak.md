# 15 rules for blogging, and my current streak

My current streak: I’ve now been writing new posts for **24 consecutive
weeks.** Multiple posts a week. How on earth? I just calculated it, and I’ve
added the live streak count to the site footer. I wonder how long I can keep
it up.

This blog has been going since February 2000. I’m writing more now, two
decades on, than I have for YEARS. That’s not _just_ because of lockdown –
it’s because, about six months ago, I set myself some rules. The rules, which
are specific to me, are intended to bump me out of certain mental traps that I
know will otherwise stop my words. And since these rules have been working
for, well, 24 weeks now, I figured I’d write them down.

So here they are, **my personal rules for blogging.**

If I have an idea for a post, at any time, I make a note of it in my drafts
folder – without delay. Or it’ll disappear.

When there’s time to write, I go through my draft posts (and recent links that
I’ve run across, I capture those too) and see if anything catches my eye. If
it does: start typing and see what happens.

This post inspired by [Tobias Revell’s recent
remark](https://blog.tobiasrevell.com/2020/09/09/box-010-being-nice-to-the-
reader/), "How does Matt Webb do this every. damn. day?"

Anyway.
