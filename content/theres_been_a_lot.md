There's been a lot about [WikiLeaks](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks "Coverage at the Guardian") recently: the leaked diplomatic cables, the
discussion of the cables, the discussion of the _ethics_ of releasing the
cables, and news about the editor-in-chief Julian Assange and his way with
women.

Bruce Sterling on WikiLeaks and Assange is a must-read: [The Blast
Shack.](http://www.webstock.org.nz/blog/2010/the-blast-shack/ "On the Webstock
site.") Not just because he digs into the sources of power, and not just
because he always sees the human in the systemic (the fact Assange is a geek
is not separable from the behaviour of his organisation) and vice-versa, but
because Sterling's metaphor and language is incisive and heady, and reading it
creates a feeling like eating too much monosodium glutamate. Get more of
Sterling [on his blog.](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/ "Bruce
Sterling, Beyond the Beyond.")

Assange's politics are themselves interesting. Aaron Bady unpacks them in
[Julian Assange and the Computer
Conspiracy:](http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-
the-computer-conspiracy-“to-destroy-this-invisible-government”/ "Well worth
reading through.") he describes the state as authoritarian, and says that this
necessarily produces conspiracy, a network of people who need to operate in
secret. Then by attacking the internal information flows of the conspiracy
(ie, releasing confidential diplomatic cables), you can provoke the conspiracy
to act against itself.
