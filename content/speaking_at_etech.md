Speaking at [ETech](http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/ "O'Reilly Emerging Tech
2008."). I've snagged a last minute speaking spot today (Tuesday) at 16h55, in
the **Mission Hills** room--I'll be rambling through ideas from science
fiction and vaguely relating it to design (a toned version of [this
talk](/notes/2006/02/scifi/ "Sci-fi I like.")). Come along. (I gave a 5 minute
science fictional tour of the Solar System yesterday, as part of the [Ignite
session](http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2002 "5 minute
talks."). This will be similar.)
