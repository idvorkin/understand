So I think they should genetically engineer trees with branch and leaf fractal
sizes such that they act as perfect frequency filters for the noise spectrum
of traffic and plant them alongside roads, because that would be prettier than
the walls that are used. Also genetically engineered grass with serrated edges
and designed cilia so when the wind blows the grass sings in a deep, filling
harmonic tone, like this: llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.
