[Video visualisations of DNA,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKjF7OumYo "During replication, the strands of DNA go through the divider at the speed of
air through a jet engine.") at the molecular level. See: DNA coiling into
chromosomes, DNA replication, transcription into RNA, the reading of RNA
instructions to assemble amino acid building blocks into a protein. Decently
explained. I get a buzzy sense of vertigo to see how we go from the
information of the genetic code all the way to proteins. (Proteins are the
building blocks of life. They're transformers and logical signal processors:
they react chemicals to make other chemicals, and can be switched on and off.
So in that sense they're super smart transistors, networking together to make
an information processing system that also channels flows of matter and
energy. And proteins are also mechanical. They can provide rigidity, and
actuation in muscles. It's as if the metal surface of your computer was made
the same stuff as the silicon chip, and it could ripple itself to move around
your desk.)
