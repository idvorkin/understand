# Dunbar’s number and how speaking is 2.8x better than picking fleas

150, Dunbar’s number, is the natural size of human social groups. Robin
Dunbar’s 1993 paper, where he put forward this hypothesis, is a great read –
it’s got twists and turns, so much more in it than just the 150 number.

_(If you design software for people to socialise or collaborate, like Slack or
Google Docs, then what Dunbar says is useful to know! Also true if you build
communities in Discords or DAOs, I reckon, good knowledge to have when
structuring the spaces and processes for interaction.)_

I’ve added a reference to Dunbar’s paper, _Coevolution of neocortical size,
group size and language in humans,_ at the bottom of this post. It’s not
online but you can [snag a pre-print PDF
here](https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/files/papers/others/1993/dunbar1993a.pdf).

The paper and the number are both super well-known.

BUT - I insist! - still not well-known _enough_ in our software and design
circles. Especially given there is a revitalisation and renewed interest in
building and innovating with the social internet.

So I figured I would share my favourite bits.

Dunbar lists a bunch of places this 150 group size appears. To pick out a
convincing selection…

It’s the number of people on your Christmas card list. When AOL Instant
Messenger launched, it was the maximum allowable number of buddies.

_(And the number of Pokemon in generation one… 151. Huh.)_

Pretty compelling. Something to be explained.

**The clever bit:**

The catarrhine primates: Old World monkeys (baboons, macaques, mandrill, and
~130 other species) plus the apes… tailless simians including gibbons,
gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans.

Dunbar’s insight was to look at the catarrhine primates and realise that
**these three factors are connected:**

Dunbar gives equations that relate these.

Then:

If we extrapolate from the nonhuman primate regression, what group size would
we predict for anatomically modern humans, given our current neocortex size?

Oh-ho, a prediction!

"Equation (1) yields a predicted group size for humans of 147.8."

So there’s the observed number 150, right there in the size of the brain.

BUT THEN, A TWIST:

"The group size predicted for modern humans by equation (1) would require as
much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming."

We _(humans)_ clearly don’t spend all that time on social grooming. There’s
not the time in the day. It’s incompatible with resting, foraging, and staying
in the shade on hot days. Chimpanzees are the most comparable to humans, and
they have a social time budget of about only 15%.

So what gives?

Humans, says Dunbar, must have **a method of social grooming that is 2.8x more
effective** than the method used by the nonhuman primates. But what is it?

What is our ultra efficient bonding mechanism, better than caring, grooming,
and picking fleas? It is LANGUAGE.

The observed mean group size for chimpanzees (presumably the closest
approximation to the ancestral condition for the hominid lineage) is 53.5
(Dunbar 1992a). Since the predicted size for human groups is 147.8, this
implies that _language_ (the human bonding mechanism) ought to be
147.8/53.5=2.76 times as efficient as social grooming (the nonhuman primate
bonding mechanism).

Speaking is way better than grooming, which requires 100% attention and is
one-on-one. But we can talk to more than one person at once! See: "not only
can speech be combined with almost every other activity (we can forage and
talk at the same time), but it can also be used to address several different
individuals simultaneously."

Dunbar’s suggestion is that language evolved as a "‘cheap’ form of social
grooming," a way to increase group size. And there follows a cascade of
consequences and speculations…

The interesting bit, for me, is about the “natural” size of a conversation
group.

Dunbar’s prediction, based on the estimated efficiency gain versus chimps:
"human conversation group sizes should be limited to about 3.8 in size (one
speaker plus 2.8 listeners)."

And this holds up!

Which feels about right, right?

I mean, think of a sitting with friends round a dinner table. Two people,
three people, four people, it’s one conversation. Five people, it’s still one
conversation – just. At six it’s hard to maintain; the conversation often
splits and oscillates between 4/2 and 3/3 modes.

The cognitive limit corresponds to how our _ears and voices_ work.

It turns out that there is, in fact, a psycho-physical limit on the size of
conversation groups. Due to the rate at which speech attenuates with the
distance between speaker and hearer under normal ambient noise levels, there
is a physical limit on the number of individuals that can effectively take
part in a conversation. Sommer (1961), for example, found that _a nose-to-nose
distance of 1.7m was the upper limit for comfortable conversation in dyadic
groups; this would yield a maximum conversation group size of five
individuals_ with a shoulder-to-shoulder spacing of 0.5m between adjacent
individuals standing around the circumference of a circle.

“Comfortable” conversation means "background noise levels typical of both
offices and city streets" – our normal voice levels, our normal hearing, our
normal comfortable personal social distance, our normal _width of shoulders_
all combine to produce conversional groups of… 5 people.

Absolutely wonderful. It makes me laugh every time I read this bit.

**Evidence for Dunbar’s Number in the analysis of 6 billion phone calls:**

Dunbar actually doesn’t say that we devote “grooming time” to the whole social
group of 150. Rather he says that the 150 is made up from "welding together"
much smaller “primary networks”: coalitions, friendship groups. Intensive
grooming (language, for humans) is reserved for close friends. Our intimate
group is very small, averaging just five.

Dunbar suggests other group sizes too, in papers that follow his 1993
original…

Individuals, he says, generally have up to five people in the closest layer.
The next closest layer contains an additional 10, the one beyond that an extra
35, and the final group another 100. So cumulatively, the layers contain five,
15, 50, and 150 people.

And this result is new to me:

Looking at "some six billion calls made by 35 million people" they did some
number crunching and…

the average cumulative layer turns out to hold 4.1, 11.0, 29.8, and 128.9
users.

Ta-da! Dunbar’s number proved, close enough.

You can get the PDF on arXiv: [Calling Dunbar’s Numbers
(2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02400). I’ve included the full reference
below.

Kinda amazing to have evidence for something that feels so intuitive (the
average number of best friends/family) and that lends confidence in the
discovery in the data of Dunbar’s number itself too.

BTW I found that second paper via [Ethan Mollick (@emollick) on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/emollick) who _daily_ shares and summarises
fascinating papers and is 100% a must-follow.

Again, why this is relevant: if you’re designing systems for working in
groups, whether that’s IRL workgroups and committees, or online chat groups,
or software, the relevant numbers are 150 people who can be recognised over
time, and approx 5 in a simultaneous conversation. That’s what it suggests to
me anyway.

The numbers are just averages, of course, and we’re each individuals and you
shouldn’t put too much weight on evo psych or be deterministic about this
stuff, but what we _can_ do is use these as springboards to provoke new
feature ideas. Such as…

(Those last two points relevant now the global public timelines of 2010s
social media are evaporating into the unindexable Discords and WhatsApp groups
of 2020s [virtual private neighbourhoods](/home/2021/01/07/dunbar_spaces).)

AND SO ON.
