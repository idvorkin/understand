Okay, this is wrestling, and then two of the dudes (who are dressed as
Egyptian gods?) hypnotise the _other_ two dudes, by doing a weird snake move,
and make them _breakdance_ themselves into being knocked out. [That is the
most illegal thing I've seen in the history of
wrestling!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU4TDGlbTz8 "Please watch this.")
(Thank you [Schulze,](http://berglondon.com/studio/jack-schulze "Jack
Schulze") that is utterly remarkable.)
