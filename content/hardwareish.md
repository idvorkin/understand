# The next hardware-ish coffee morning is next Thursday

My Dearest Droogs,

Let’s have a hardware-ish coffee morning! Soon!

**Thursday 19 October, 9.30am for a couple of hours, at[the Book
Club](http://www.wearetbc.com), 100 Leonard St.**

I’ll be back from my travels, moderately jetlagged, and in no state to conduct
linear conversations. So it will be especially important to (a) talk to
everyone else who comes (they’re always really friendly); and, (b) poke me in
the ribs if you see me nodding off.

Usual rules: we don’t do intros; everyone talks to everyone else; you order
coffee from the counter and please don’t forget to pay otherwise the staff get
confused; bring a prototype if you have one; actually working with hardware IS
NOT A requirement, you just have to be curious. [Here’s what happened last
time.](http://interconnected.org/home/2017/07/03/hardwareish)

Might be 5 people, might be 25. If you’re a startup and want to ask me about
the new [R/GA IoT Venture Studio](http://www.rgaiot.com), I am happy to chat.
