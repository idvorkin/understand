My favourite short story is _The Author of the Acacia Seeds and Other Extracts
from the Journal of the Association of Therolinguistics_ by [Ursula K. Le
Guin](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/). It's a story of language, translation,
and understanding things in terms of themselves, and - like all of Le Guin's
best - progressively takes me so far outside myself that I can glimpse what it
would be like to live non-sequentially, sideways to time, or without action
and with only response. Le Guin helps me understand how historically
contingent _I_ am (personally and socially) , which helps me accept the points
of views of others, human and non-human. Anyway, it's a story which can be
read into endlessly, and also beautiful: It helps me see meaning in broader
scales and configurations than those to which I am accustomed. (Le Guin's
_Always Coming Home_ is in [my top 5
books](/home/2005/06/02/tom_coates_passed_me "Technically, I suppose, '5 books
that mean a lot to me.'").)

I've wanted to share it with friends, but short stories are inconvenient to
pass round because you have to lend the whole book. So I've transcribed the
story and put it online. I hope many more people read Le Guin because of it.
Read [The Author of the Acacia Seeds](/home/more/2007/03/acacia-seeds.html "'The Author of the Acacia Seeds and Other Extracts from the Journal of the
Association of Therolinguistics' by Ursula K. Le Guin.").
