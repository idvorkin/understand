With reference to [that music video
yesterday](/home/2008/01/02/what_i_like_most "The marching sugar cubes."), I
come to a [familiar](/2002/01/27/the_video_to_star "Generative music videos
should be better.") [complaint](/home/2006/01/23/music_video_for_daft "Same
argument, only this time I suggest building it in AutoCAD."): there should
exist an iTunes music visualiser that looks exactly like Michel Gondry's [Star
Guitar](http://www.director-file.com/gondry/chemical2.html "Stills and links
to videos."). If someone offered to make that for me, I would find a way to
bring it into the world. In this [Making
Of](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nDUnEEtrHw "Actually pretty freaking
cool.") video, Gondry prototypes Star Guitar using oranges and VHS video
cassettes.

[Audiosurf](http://www.audio-surf.com/ "Better.") "allows you to experience
the intensity and emotion of your songs in real time, in full color, and in
3D. Songs that give you an adrenaline rush are converted into wild roller
coaster rides full of color and motion. Songs that calm you down appear as
cool colors against a relaxing sky." (Releases February 2008.)
