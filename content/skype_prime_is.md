[Skype Prime is included in the new Skype 3.1 beta on
Windows](http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2007/03/skype_prime_beta_introducing_t.html "'The global expertise marketplace.'"). Skype Prime allows you to charge a
one-off or per-minute fee for people to call you. Perfect for premium rate
voice services. But what else does it enable? I've [talked about Skype as a
platform before](http://interconnected.org/home/2006/04/30/skype_allows_two "Software distribution and automated voice services."). What automated voice
services could be built--perhaps, simply, a voicemail system as a front-end to
a dictation service? It could work like this: You call a number, which happens
to be running on Skype. You pay a per-minute charge, and dictate a message.
The call is recorded and when you hang up, the mp3 is pushed to [Mechanical
Turk](http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome "Distributed micropayment labour.")
for transcription. The text is emailed back to you. Of course there's no
reason this couldn't be done with [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/ "Soft
telephony system for home or office use.") or some other
[transcription](http://www.escriptionist.com/ "More suitable for work use.")
[service](http://castingwords.com/ "Focused at the Web 2.0/podcasting
world."), but the advantages here are: Skype has micropayments built in; you
can run it from a desktop machine; the technology makes it easier to prototype
so you can concentrate on the experience.

What else? The one-off payment means Skype Prime could be used for software
distribution. You pay your money, you get a file in return. Granted, it
doesn't scale well and software distribution can happen in many ways... but
for an individual selling home-made ebooks or movies, a simple plug-in to
allow this could be easier than setting up online.

Given all this, if I was Skype I'd be working on a server-side Skype
component. I'd want to allow, for example, [Ruby on
Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/ "Framework of choice for long-tail
websites.") apps to run dynamic voice menus, call in and out, and offer
premium services.
