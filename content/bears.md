# Just a quick couple of links about bears, because I’ve been busy today

The original word for bear has been lost. From [this article about
euphemisms](http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2041313,00.html):

Our ancient ancestors were so worried about bears, they didn’t even want to
name them because they feared [the bears] might overhear and come after them.
So they came up with this word – this is up in Northern Europe – _bruin,_
meaning “the brown one” as a euphemism, and then _bruin_ segued into _bear._
We know the euphemism, **but we don’t know what word it replaced**

There’s some more about bears and also mushrooms and dandelions in [this old
blog post](/home/2017/09/11/filtered).
