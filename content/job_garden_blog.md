# I’m also blogging over at the Job Garden blog

It’s been a little quiet on this site lately. A bunch of my writing energy has
been going into weekly posts on the [Job Garden blog.](https://medium.com/job-

Job Garden is a new kind of social job board. I started building it because I

It’s a real scratch-my-own-itch kind of thing. Right now on my personal job
board there are 38 open roles at 12 companies, and [you can check them out

It’s only 12 weeks old. I try to add something to it every week. So this week:

just London jobs.

It’s super simple (the tech is entirely within my comfort zone), there’s zero
visual design, in terms of stage it’s like _pre-pre-alpha,_ and it’s fun to
stretch these muscles that haven’t had a workout in a long ol’ while.

The weekly posts can be a bit rambly, and occassionally stray into the realm
of “half-thought-through opinions about code” which, who knows, might be
entirely up your street.

categories.](https://medium.com/job-garden/tagged/weeknotes)
