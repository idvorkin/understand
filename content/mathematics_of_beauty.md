"If someone doesn't think you're hot, the next best thing for them to think is
that you're ugly." \-- OKCupid (the dating site) did some [awesome research
into the mathematics of beauty,](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-
mathematics-of-beauty/ "Stats madness.") by looking at hotness ratings and
number of messages received. They looked at consensus over cuteness. You get
more approaches if some people think you're hot and some people think you're
ugly, compared to everyone thinking you're merely cute.

This is the conclusion: "_We now have mathematical evidence that minimizing
your "flaws" is the opposite of what you should do._ If you're a little
chubby, play it up. If you have a big nose, play it up. If you have a weird
snaggletooth, play it up: statistically, the guys who don't like it can only
help you, and the ones who do like it will be all the more excited."

I used to draw the _yay/nay/meh_ triangle when talking about people's
reactions to brands. You can choose to be on one side of the triangle. And -
my opinion - it's better to be a yay/nay brand than to be a yay/meh one.
Yay/nay at least means everyone is passionate. But yay/meh? There's not much
you can do with indifference.
