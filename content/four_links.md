A few links today.

[Surface detail,](http://vimeo.com/18842873 "Vimeo") a video of a computer-
generated 3D fractal surface, like an animated [Romanesque
broccoli.](http://grocerytrekker.blogspot.com/2007/02/romanesque-fractal-
broccoli.html "Nice photo")

A wonderfully targeted shop this, [tiny things are
cute,](http://www.tinythingsarecute.com/ "Little things for sale.") "an
emporium of little lovelies and wily whatnots." For example, [tiny things you
never knew you
wanted.](http://www.tinythingsarecute.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=6_7 "Shop page.")

[Pinoko's collection of inspiring
artwork.](http://blog.ponoko.com/2011/01/17/ten-amazing-works-of-art/ "Fractals and spirographs.") Generally, sort-of computer generated but
existing in a physical way. Butterflies, a toy car racing track [with
astounding complexity,](http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/23/metropolis-ii-the-
kinetic-sculpture-built-out-of-boy-racer-drea/ "Watch the video") and heavy
metal shovels cut in lace patterns.

[Shoaling and schooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling "Wikipedia article about fish.") are different things: "any group of fish that
stay together for social reasons are said to be _shoaling,_ and if, in
addition, the group is swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner,
they are said to be _schooling._" (If the fish are together but _not_ for
social reasons, for example because of a common food source, this is called an
_aggregation._) It's interesting to think of communities of people in these
terms, as they move from a gathering, to a group which has its own identity,
to a work group with some kind of common purpose.
