Books read February 2008, with date finished:

There's been a smell, biochemistry and science theme: scent [last
month](/home/2008/01/31/books_read_january_2008 "Books read January 2008. 'The
Secret of Scent' is the one I'm talking about."), then Aphrodite, Latour,
Calvino and Essential Cell Biology. It's all felt a bit [Powers of
10](http://www.powersof10.com/ "Eames film.")... not just from seeing the
proteins behind the experience of taste and food, but reading straight-forward
textbooks and simultaneously being aware the colossal energy and practice of
science that went into producing facts.

_Science in Action_ is the stand-out book this month. I studied physics at
college, and have had heated debates both with those who regard science as
entirely a social construction and those who believe in big-s Science (as a
process and as outcomes. Mainly people without a science background
curiously). Latour is the first I've read to describe science as I've seen it,
and to show in a single breath the complex interplay of humans and nonhumans.
Superb.
