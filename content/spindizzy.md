# Progress (and flying cities) via mining the discard pile

Sometime around the 3300s, entire cities fly faster than light across the
galaxy, working for hire for industrial planets. Populated by almost-
immortals, powered and shielded by an antigravity device called a _spindizzy_
the greatest of these is New York.

The spindizzy is more formally the Dillon-Wagoner gravitron polarity
generator, built on the principles of the Blackett-Dirac equations: "Every
culture has its characteristic mathematic, in which its toriographers can see
its inevitable social form." – from its first invention in 2018 (it was re-
discovered later) the spindizzy enabled and ordained the takeoff and
subsequent galactic society of itinerant cities.

The first book of James Blish’s [Cities in
Flight](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cities-Flight-MASTERWORKS-James-
Blish/dp/0575094176) _(They Shall Have Stars, 1956)_ covers the discovery of
the spindizzy.

The West has entered a stagnant, paranoid state. Science has stalled. The
scientific method has become obsolete: "the more subtle the facts to be
discovered become … the more expensive and time-consuming it is to investigate
them" – which leaves the unimaginative government as the only potential
funder.

Instead? Dig through the slush pile, "the crackpots" – "sports, freaks, near-
misses."

You need marginal contributors, scientists of good reputation generally whose
obsessions don’t strike fire with the other members of their profession. Like
the Crehore atom, or old Ehrenhaft’s theory of magnetic currents, or the Milne
cosmology

So they dig for two years…

checking patents that had been granted but not sequestered, published
scientific papers containing suggestions other scientists had decided not to
explore, articles in the lay press about incipient miracles which hadn’t come
off, science-fiction stories by practicing scientists, anything and everything
that might lead somewhere.

And eventually find the Blackett equation, which had been suggested way back
in 1948 but was not testable – at the time.

Then they test it, and it works, and they invent the spindizzy, and then they
fly to Jupiter in 3 days, and a thousand years later Earth is a garden planet
with its old factories and cities alike now aloft, flitting between the stars.

I love stories of the exhilaration and work of scientific discovery. I could
read them all day.

Anyway so X-_nee_ -Twitter is alive with talk of LK-99, [the Ambient
Superconductor of the
Summer](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/science/lk-99-superconductor-
ambient.html) _(New York Times),_ which purports to be a miracle material,
discovered in South Korea, unveiled to the world with much surprise and fuss,
and - if real - is a capital-B Big capital-D Deal in that room temperature
superconductivity would enable tiny electronics, maglev trains, and all the
rest.

_(Honestly we could just build regular trains without superconductor magnet
levitation and that would be great too, but that’s another story.)_

Of course it’s extremely likely that the LK-99 claims are _not_ true. The
papers on arXiv are missing the actual evidence of superconductivity, the labs
trying to replicate the claimed characteristics of the material have not yet
been successful, and the news is somewhat suspiciously timed given that (I
hear) the material itself was discovered in 2020 and its disclosure now
coincides with the company behind it trying to raise money.

BUT!

[I have a fantasy of a glitch in the universe.](/home/2020/10/27/glitch) And
so I am happy to bathe contented in the possibility and enjoy these few days
before the fantasy comes crashing down, just as it did with desktop cold
fusion, and just as it did with Italian FTL neutrinos.

Which is why I went back and re-read the beginning of _Cities in Flight._

There’s something about Blish’s idea of winnowing the chaff of the scientific
discard pile.

Like: maybe new ideas are ten a penny, and the scientific progress pipeline is
replication-bottlenecked.

It reminds me of writing. There’s drafting and editing and the two are
distinct. Perhaps, in science, we don’t need new ideas (drafting) right now.
But editing is constrained.

For two reasons. Being (a) there aren’t enough people who can follow up on
ideas, and (b) ideas are put forward and its not at the time possible to
replicate or test them, or they don’t fit into the conceptual framework… yet.

I’m thinking of VR?

The problem with virtual reality, which has been tried a number of times over
the decades, isn’t that it’s a fundamentally bad idea that makes 20% of people
VR sick. It is eye-wateringly astounding even if I do have to chew ginger
gummies to keep the nausea down when I’m wearing my headset.

No the hurdles have been miniaturised technology (screens and gyros) and go-
to-market strategy, Apple’s take on the latter being social impedance matching
(external screens so you can still make “eye” contact) and positioning the
first read of the Vision Pro product as basically a large, high DPI external
monitor that also happens to be portable, and _also_ also happens to enable
multiplayer VR (but that’s not the initial sell), i.e. a bargain.

These can be overcome with cash and will, sure, but as challenges they’re not
in the same taxon that impeded AI, for example, which required a true and
fundamental breakthrough.

Maybe it is worth going back to other ideas from the 1980s and seeing what
_else_ didn’t work then, being just too wild, but would today, given four
decades of technology, industrial base, and consumer readiness?

Like, what’s the go-to-market strategy for a Drexler molecular assembler?

This is just for example but what I’m saying is, could we have another run at
3D printers? Think really, really hard about the consumer go-to-market. Maybe
we missed something last time round; maybe the context has changed over the
years.

I would automate this abandoned invention threshing process.

Then scale what works.

RELATED: I also have an essay on [the automated discovery of new areas of
thought](/home/2021/06/16/horsehistory), which starts with the concept of
_horsehistory._

_Personally:_

What ideas did I once upon a time flip the bit on as unachievable but actually
I should now revisit? That’s the real lesson here.

For example: back in 2021 [I had an idea for a galactic
compass](/home/2021/06/30/galaxy), that is, an iPhone app with a floating
arrow that always points directly to black hole at the middle of the Milky
Way.

I couldn’t build it then. But recently I realised that ChatGPT could walk me
through writing an iOS app. So now it’s an actual thing! [On my
homescreen!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvh3iE3tw1U/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
It works! (Mostly.)

_(Hey lmk if you’d like to get on the TestFlight as a beta user, I just need
your Apple ID.**Also let me know if you understand a bit about SceneKit and
combining rotations with quaternions,** because I’m in a muddle with the math
and I’m getting some drift on the azimuth. The astro equations are fine, but
I’ve got a 10 degree error in combining it with the device rotation. I need
help fixing that bug because GPT, not being embodied, is even worse than I am
at thinking in 3D.)_

But not just tech, right? All kinds of personal ideas.

What do I deep-down believe is out of reach for me that I could now achieve if
I just tried? One’s mind bends around assumed-impossibilities; I can’t imagine
them to enumerate them. I wonder what the threshing algorithm would be like in
order to dig them up.
