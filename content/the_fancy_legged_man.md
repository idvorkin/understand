[The fancy-legged fellow isn't allowed in the
Olympics](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/athletics/7141302.stm "Sprung metal legs."), as his disadvantaged compensator unfairly advantages
him. Huh. [Tiger Woods has surgically upgraded his vision to
20/15](http://www.slate.com/id/2116858/ "It's also happening a lot in
baseball."). There exist [Nike
Vision](http://www.nike.com/nikevision/main.html "I can only see the glasses
on here.") contact lenses which selectively enhance colours so golfers can see
the ball better on the putting green. In answer to the question _how much is
too much?_ , we should let the market decide: all modifications should be
allowed until [betting exchanges](http://www.betfair.com/ "Illegal in the
puritan USA, bizarrely.") refuse to take wagers on the athlete. The athlete
must declare all prosthetics and performance enhancers ahead of time.

Alongside graphics cards, we'll soon have quantum computing chips which will
take certain calculations, handed off to them by the CPU, and rifle through
parallel universes looking for the answer, super quick. In addition we'll have
[prediction market](http://www.iwar.org.uk/news-archive/tia/futuremap-
program.htm "Cancelled.") co-processors: a petri dish of bacteria specially
bred to exhibit the supply/demand curves of [perfectly rational economic
agents](http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Rational.htm "From the outside they
behave just like you and me."), tucked just behind the battery to the side of
the hard-drive. ([I wrote a story](http://masochuticon.com/2006/07/05/ "It's
predictive markets crossed with Mechanical Turk, at Masochuticon, and not one
of my best stories.") that mentioned something similar.)

2008 is the year we hit [Peak Attention](http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/ "But I thought there was 40 years left!"). You can either carry on
encountering as much as you do now, giving every input less and less attention
every year, or you can start managing it, keeping some back to take long-haul
attention flights. What are the consequences of living post-Peak Attention?
Nobody will be able to understand anything hard unless they make sacrifices.

The [xkcd IRC channel will hit Peak Unique Sentences in
2010](http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-
noise-in-chat/ "Actually this is a fucking brilliant idea.") after which being
funny is hard because all the good sentences are used up. But just like domain
names, this will cause a fluorescence in amusingly spelled cuss words.

Actually having single people who are delegated to understand hard things
while other people process trivialities is _fine._ Thought and understanding
are networked, social activities: [cognition is
distributed](http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/Anthro179a/DistributedCognition.pdf "Distributed Cognition, Edwin Hutchins.") [pdf]. For a mass of people to make
a decision, they form a _decision making organ_ , which is a particular body
formed to that job. It purifies group opinion as the liver purifies blood.

Every time I mention an idea, I'm giving it attention cycles from all you
readers. Attention is the bile of the public thinking stomach organ, breaking
it down and digesting it, distributing it to the rest of the body public in
recombinant forms.

The entities in a group of people aren't only the humans, but the organs made
of sub-groups. Like [Conway's Life
parts](http://pentadecathlon.com/lifeNews/index.php "Game of Life patterns
blog.") that perform different functions. Like [Standard Biological
Parts](http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/Main_Page "Biological
abstractions. Grow your own camera.") stitched end to end. Organisations
should be thought of as organs that specialise to think, co-ordinate, propel,
introduce novelty, gather food, defend or fight, in a way that self-
reinforces: a body.
