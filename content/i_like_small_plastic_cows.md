I like small plastic cows. I don't know why. I haven't owned any until today.
For many years I have wanted a herd for my home, and 100 would do nicely. But
there is no way I can justify spending that much money on plastic animals. I
could however justify giving that same amount to charity. So how about 100
people buy me 1 cow each, and then I give Â£500 to the charity they vote for?
_It's a win-win._ It's [Matt Webb's 100 Head Cattle Drive

a promise.")! Pass it on, buy a cow, round 'em up and roll 'em out.
