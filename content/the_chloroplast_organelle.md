The chloroplast organelle, which performs photosynthesis in plants, is more
complex, structurally, than the mitochondria which use oxygen to turn food
molecules into ATP (energy-carrying chemical; an abstract interface) in most
eucaryotes. Eucaryotes are cells with a nucleus--cells without a nucleus are
procaryotes, which come as eubacteria and archaea.

Mitochondria, themselves, appear to be bacteria captured by procaryotes very
early in the evolution of cells with nuclei, and now the two live
symbiotically.

Two crazy things:

Life: amazing. (Current reading is
