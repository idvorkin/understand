The [Experimental Nonlinear Physics
Groups](http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~nonlin/index.html "Awesome page to
explore.") (University of Toronto) have made a [spiral defect knitting
pattern.](http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~nonlin/sweater.html "Pictures!
Movies!") This is the swirling chaotic pattern that arises with a heat
difference across pressurised carbon dioxide. [It's pretty when it
moves.](http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~nonlin/pub/sp_chaos.mpg "MPEG movie.")

(Apropos of nothing, a video of [a baby monkey riding backwards on a
pig.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_sfnQDr1-o "YouTube is a gift to
