[The Year of Practical
Thinking,](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/opinions/the_year_of_practical_thinking.php "Some of my favourite articles are big lists.") by Giles Turnbull: "They say
you learn something every day." [TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/ "Today I Learned") that every day in 2010, Giles wrote that thing down.
Brilliant; funny; read 'em all.

See also: [read more wikipedia,](http://www.readmorewikipedia.com/ "Lovely
