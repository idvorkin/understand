_The Popular Science Monthly,_ May 1877, “On the habits of ants” by Sir John
Lubbock:

Landois is of [the] opinion that ants also make sounds in the same way [by
rubbing their abdominal rings against another], though these sounds are
inaudible to us. Our range is, however, after all, very limited, and **the
universe is probably full of music which we cannot perceive.**

Emphasis mine.

static is doing and what it means.

My life has not been the same since I learnt that famously-silent giraffes are
not in fact mute.

At midnight, in the pitch black, the neck becomes like a pipe organ, and they
do this crazy deep ethereal HUMMING. Not kidding:

All I can think of is Palaeolithic humans on the African plains, it’s the dead
of night, and they’re just bathing in this all-pervasive
[ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response)-inducing
hum, the giraffes’ 14 Hz infrasound [skewering the
soul](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3087674.stm), the dark savannah as a
nightly cathedral with no walls and for its roof the eternal stars.
