# The Times They Are A-Changin’

_The Times They Are A-Changin’_ by Bob Dylan (1963).

Come gather ‘round people  
Wherever you roam  
And admit that the waters  
Around you have grown  
And accept it that soon  
You’ll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin’  
Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone  
For the times they are a-changin’

Come writers and critics  
Who prophesize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide  
The chance won’t come again  
And don’t speak too soon  
For the wheel’s still in spin  
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’  
For the loser now will be later to win  
For the times they are a-changin’

Come senators, congressmen  
Please heed the call  
Don’t stand in the doorway  
Don’t block up the hall  
For he that gets hurt  
Will be he who has stalled  
There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’  
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls  
For the times they are a-changin’

Come mothers and fathers  
Throughout the land  
And don’t criticize  
What you can’t understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command  
Your old road is rapidly agin’  
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand  
For the times they are a-changin’

The line it is drawn  
The curse it is cast  
The slow one now  
Will later be fast  
As the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin’  
And the first one now will later be last  
For the times they are a-changin’

I’ve had this on repeat the last week or so.

Ancient wisdom from the vibe shift of another generation.

[It sounds so innocuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90WD_ats6eE)
_(YouTube)._ Dylan with his level tone and that harmonica. It’s timeless. But
then you listen to the [lyrics](https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/times-they-are-
changin/)…

That fourth verse? Gives me shivers.

[Some background over at
Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-
Changin%27\_\(song\))

You get those eras where everything up-ends. The axes on which the world is
measured no longer make sense. On the other side, there are new institutions,
new ways of operating, new ways of feeling. Until now, it hasn’t been like
that.

As a Gen X tailender, the last couple decades have felt a bit like an eternal
1990s. But I want to be baffled by music! I want to be surprised by culture!

And now – it’s happening? I love it. I love Gen Z. I love being continuously
challenged to re-configure my internal scaffolding. I love their energy. It’s
infectious. They’re grappling with the world - politics and identity and
fashion and everything else - and that’s infectious too.

Anyway, what does a vibe shift feel like? And how should you act? Dylan wrote
this song as documentary, last time round – "a voice that came from you and
me" [as Don MacLean put it](https://genius.com/Don-mclean-american-pie-
lyrics).

It’s funny, I must have heard it a thousand times, and I’ve really only
_heard_ it this week.

On a technical note, reading the final verse it looks like it should speed up.
Shorter words, fewer beats per line.

As a writer, to me, that’s an acceleration.

BUT music is rhythmic. Each verse is the same length. So shorter lines mean
the words have more room. It’s almost not noticeable but in that final verse,
the words extend, they grow and lift.

So it ends on a note of power. Not urgency but strength. It hadn’t occurred to
me before that music would work like this.

There’s a growing coalition around change. Change first, values next. Break
the logjam, end [the great
stagnation](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-
the-great-stagnation-end.html), crack the egg on a societal level, whatever
you want to call it. The coalition connects ugly politics burning it all to
the ground and shitposting inventors on the socials. I mean, it’s not a
coalition that can hold, clearly. And I’m sure many in it would deny their
participation.

But if we are to (say) get through the climate crisis, the ability to change
is a prerequisite. And it is all connected, [the opening the Overton window of
weirdness is contagious](/home/2024/06/21/overton).

Though when things do get moving, we’ll all start arguing about which way. And
who knows how it’ll settle out. One side or the other or more likely some
unimagined and unimaginable synthesis/detente.

That’s the ancient roadmap in the song.

For the wheel’s still in spin  
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’

Vibe shifts eh. [As previously discussed.](/home/2022/03/11/saeculum)
