Gorgeous mechanism: [Japanese tea-serving
automaton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TeaAutomatAndMechanism.jpg "Wood
and prettiness.") from the 19th century (photo).

The [Digesting Duck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digesting_Duck "With
picture.") was created in France in 1739. It would eat and defecate grain.

Around 450 BC, the ancient Greek island of Rhodes was [so well known for its
robots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton#Ancient_automata "Some robots
from ancient Greece.") that the poet Pindar wrote of it:

"The animated figures stand  
Adorning every public street  
And seem to breathe in stone, or  
move their marble feet."
