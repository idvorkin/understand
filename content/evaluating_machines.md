[In defense of machines,](http://www.harpers.org/archive/1932/06/0018283 "Harpers magazine.") by George Boas: "We are first told that though man
invented [machines] to be his servants he has become theirs. ... This argument
is a gross exaggeration. Man is no more a slave of his machines than he has
ever been, or than he is to his body ..."

"We must each establish a system of values for ourselves or absorb that of our
social group, and judge machines by it as we do everything else. There is no
other way of evaluating anything."
