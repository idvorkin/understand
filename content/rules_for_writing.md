[Ten rules for writing
fiction,](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-
fiction-part-one "From multiple authors, in the Guardian.") from many authors
(and here's [part two).](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/20/10-rules-
for-writing-fiction-part-two "Rules for writing fiction.") I met Gareth W.
this morning who recommended these, and [he's picked out some
favourites.](http://gawragbag.blogspot.com/2010/02/getting-engine-warmed-
up.html "Newspaper Club CEO.") Worth a read! In particular, he pointed me at
this one: "Write every day. That way, the book you're working on is never out
of your awareness for long. It will always be percolating in the back of your
mind, growing on its own. _No part of writing is as hard as getting the engine
warmed up,_ so try not to let it cool down." Amen.
