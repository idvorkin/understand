# Parish notices

No coffee morning this week… busy busy busy. I’m Entrepreneur in Residence at
Techstars London, and the [Winter 2014
cohort](http://www.techstars.com/announcing-the-10-companies-for-the-london-
winter-2014-class/) is gearing up for its Demo Day on Friday. It’s a cross
between a massive pitch (several hundred investors will be there) and a
[debutante ball.](http://www.techstars.com/announcing-the-10-companies-for-
the-london-winter-2014-class/) So all the startups are doing a ton of prep -
they get 5 minutes each - I’m helping out where I can.

Next coffee morning [(what it
is)](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/01/22/coffee_morning_5) will be next
Thurs, Feb 26.

Looking at my stats, more people click through from [Dan Hon’s email
newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/danhon) than any of the (high profile!)
blogs or Twitter accounts that have also linked here from time to time.

It’s pretty clear that [mobile browsing is
broken](https://twitter.com/genmon/status/567061010096619520) for idle reading
and following trails, and that - for the moment at least - people enjoy email
instead.

So I’ve set up Interconnected-by-email. [Subscribe
