Today is the anniversary of the final day of the life of Laura Palmer. When I
was young, I was crazy for _Twin Peaks._ [Laura Palmer was found dead, wrapped
in plastic, on 24 February, 1989.](http://www.twinpeaks.org/faqeps.htm#e5 "Old
school text FAQ.") Also: you can read [her secret
diary.](http://www.glastonberrygrove.net/texts/lpdiary.html "Secret Diary of
Laura Palmer")
