Bruce Sterling's essay [The Last Viridian
Note](http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/451-500/the_last_viridian_note.html "'Key concepts: summaries, farewells, Papal_Imperial sermons, the end of a
design movement'") is only partly the final message from a design movement --
although it is that: the Viridian movement is an approach to sustainability
that eschews the hair shirt and belt-tightening. Viridian is _bright green_
environmentalism. Sustainability through technology and design. No, the _Last
Viridian_ is a manifesto for a way of living.

Sterling identifies four categories of products to allow into your life:

(I spoke at the [Luxury Briefing conference](http://www.luxury-
briefing.com/content/lb/downloads/Conference*DPS.pdf "PDF") yesterday about
the stories that products tell, and about illusionary faces and little robots.
Everyone was well dressed and wonderfully friendly. It was interesting to see
how closely many "luxury" products align with the Last Viridian manifesto. Of
course, many don't. My key takeaways: there exist online artificial
personality constructs for the purposes of market research; there is a drug in
the Amazon that makes you see god, and another that lets you see camouflaged
animals, and yet another that heals your mouth; the future of retail is
\_charm.* The idea of charm has stuck with me.)
