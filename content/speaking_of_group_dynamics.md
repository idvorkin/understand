Speaking of group dynamics [(as I did,
briefly)](/home/2011/01/01/books_read_in_2010 "Experiences in Groups, read in
2010."), the [Group dynamics page on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_dynamics "Actually really
good.") has a really good References section that mentions Bion and Forsyth
amongst others.

And on that topic, I didn't remember that Clay Shirky's (now classic) essay [A
Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy](http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html "O'Reilly Emerging Tech keynote 2003.") references Bion's ideas so heavily. In
particular, he runs through Bion's three patterns that groups enter when
avoiding a more sophisticated purpose: sex talk; identification and
vilification of external enemies; and religious veneration. (These are
archetypes of more complex behaviours that you'll definitely recognise.)

Says Shirky: "So these are human patterns that have shown up on the Internet,
not because of the software, but because it's being used by humans."

In _A Group Is,_ Shirky defines "social software," examines it, and sets out
what to design for. This essay is nearly 8 years old and I'd forgotten how
detailed and foundational it is.
