# Labour poetry

I am taken with _dagong shige,_ “labour poetry,” a genre that has emerged from
the 300 million workers who have migrated across China to the big cities over
the past four decades, as described in _The Economist:_

Its most famous practitioner was Xu Lizhi, who worked on an assembly line for
Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm that makes most of Apple’s iPhones. Before he
committed suicide in 2014, at the age of 24, he had written almost 200 poems
about the drudgery of factory work. Among the best known is “I Swallowed An
Iron Moon”:

Here’s the poem.

**I Swallowed an Iron Moon, Xu Lizhi**

I swallowed an iron moon  
they called it a screw  
I swallowed industrial wastewater and unemployment forms  
bent over machines, our youth died young  
I swallowed labour, I swallowed poverty  
swallowed pedestrian bridges, swallowed this rusted-out life  
I can’t swallow any more  
everything I’ve swallowed roils up in my throat  
I spread across my country  
a poem of shame

Some of the literature refers to powerlessness and homesickness; others are
proud and patriotic.

It must be a strange mix of emotions to be part of a movement so strong and so
vast which is lifting the largest country in the world out of poverty and is
literally building the nation and the world, but at the same time to be, well,
far from home and oppressed.

I’m reminded of the British war poets: Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen… I mean
[Dulce et Decorum Est](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46560/dulce-et-
decorum-est) is so vivid and so bitter - it’s a hard read, even with
familiarity, and it’s hard to imagine how the imagination could be brought
closer to the trenches of the Great War.

What is the role of this kind of art?

Maybe it sits midway between being

Which is vital.

I don’t know about poetry but there were, appointed by the British government,
[official war
artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_official_war_artists) for the
First and Second World Wars.

It is a shame that the government did not appoint official pandemic artists,
to document and interpret the empty streets of the lockdown, the [paranoia
inherent in Covid itself](/home/2021/08/06/paranoia), the masks and the
bubbles and the supermarket shelves and the diversity of experiences, the
whole 18 months and wherever it goes next.
