I completed reading 104 books in 2008 (I also completed [104 in
2007](/home/2007/12/26/i_completed_reading "The whole list is there.")). There
are individual monthly lists:
[January](/home/2008/01/31/books_read_january_2008 "9");
[February](/home/2008/02/29/books_read_february_2008 "11");
[March](/home/2008/03/30/books_read_march_2008 "10");
[April](/home/2008/05/01/books_read_april_2008 "10");
[May](/home/2008/06/01/books_read_may_2008 "12");
[June](/home/2008/07/02/books_read_june_2008 "5");
[July](/home/2008/08/07/books_read_july_2008 "5");
[August](/home/2008/08/30/books_read_august_2008 "12");
[September](/home/2008/09/30/books_read_september_2008 "10");
[October](/home/2008/11/04/books_read_october_2008 "8");
[November](/home/2008/11/30/books_read_november_2008 "7"); and
[December](/home/2008/12/31/books_read_december_2008 "5").

Those lists have links too. Here I just want to pull out my favourites. I made
it a rule to recommend one book a month--I've highlighted those in bold, and
put together those 12 make an incredible package.

Some common themes: last man on earth and journeys; stories that emerge only
through the motion of the reader through the book; post-war history;
alternatives to the cause and effect model; frontiers and open vistas; the big
picture.

I'm not reading to a target next year. I don't have such a long commute any
longer and I'd like to watch more films. I don't mind saying that a good deal
of 2008 has been pretty eventful, and between that and some of the excellent
books I've encountered, I'm slowly developing new ways of thinking and talking
about myself, the world and how things happen in it. I'd like to take time to
explore those ideas in 2009, and shape and fold them myself.

As a final curious constraint, I'm going to recommend three books from my 2008
reading, ones that I hadn't read before and now I think you definitely should
if you haven't already (though really I would choose a different three from
those highlighted 12 each time I picked): Impro, Keith Johnstone; Annals of
the Former World, John McPhee; On the Road, Jack Kerouac.
