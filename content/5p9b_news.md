Some updates for that space+birthdays Twitter bot [I launched a couple weeks

The bot just passed 300 active users, which is not bad!

quick+dirty to make, but a neat way to get to learn about drawing 3D graphics.
I like the way it looks, so I’m thinking about how to use these kind of
animations for the bot.
