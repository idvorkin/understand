Blogs were a different kind of conversational before [permalinks were
invented](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/06/on_permalinks_and_paradigms/ "I remember getting very exciting about these, and implementing them.
Permalinks! A technology!"). This was also before categories, and titles, and
topic-specific blogs, and professional bloggers. Permalinks and titles
encourage us to face outward, to package our ideas in chunks for easy
consumption by the reading machine (um, that's you). But I'm sure permalinks
weren't that, to begin with. They were more like putting a timestamp in
whenever the virtual [carriage return
lever](http://www.explainthatstuff.com/typewriter.html "A typewriter is like
playing the piano with hammers, on ink instead of sound, and paper instead of
ears.") was pulled.

Here's an [Orangina Naturally Juicy
commercial](http://youtube.com/watch?v=kHA9Ig7HOGA "People who don't drink
artificial foodstuffs are perverts, by implication."), which is aimed at
[furries](http://fursuit.timduru.org/dirlist/InTheNews/vanityFair/article/ "You can insult them all you want, they won't hear. They're all in Second
Life."). Speaking of which, I learned about a new fetish: **financial
domination**. A financial dominatrix is like a camgirl who hurts you via your
wallet. She won't take her clothes off, or answer your questions, but you can
pay her $100 because [you're a spineless worm with deep
pockets](http://paymissbrittany.com/free/pay_miss_brittany.php "I'm not
kidding."). Seems like a good racket. And there's something hilarious about
[Goddess Hannah's Amazon Wish List](http://www.mymoneypiggy.com/tribute/ "I
wouldn't worship a god with those shoes.").

A related note: [the sex singularity is when machines surpass humans in
hotness](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/12/28/the-sex-singularity.html "Huh,
true.").

Vikram Chandra, [The Cult of
Authenticity](http://bostonreview.net/BR25.1/chandra.html "Awesome article:
'India's cultural commissars worship 'Indianness' instead of art.'"): when an
Indian author puts a cow or mentions dharma, are they doing it "to exoticize
the Indian landscape to signal their Indianness to the West, in the context of
the Western market"? Authenticity, as Chandra tells it, is one of those gods
that people speak on behalf of constantly, but never speaks for itself. The
trinity of these gods that looms largest in the UK is: anti-discrimination;
health & safety; security. Is there a word for this general type? And what is
the larger system of words that discrimination and its evil twin, political
correctness fit into?

Matt Jones wants to [scamper between beautiful
extremes](http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/2007/12/28/glanceable-pored-over/ "One day I'll be that concise.") of pored-over and glanceable information
design.

Google have introduced [instant messaging chat bots that translate
languages](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-12-19-n41.html "There's a
screenshot."). I wonder what the conversational UI is like for these, in group
chats?

In Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's **Watchman** (spoilers: [cracking interview
from March 1988](http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/?p=613 "This is why
Watchmen is great.")), Ozymandias sits in his Antarctic base and watches
dozens of television broadcasts simultaneously, letting patterns float up and
predicting the future from the gestalt. ''[Just me and the
world.](http://flickr.com/photos/ebb/2154624599/ "Buy into munitions.")'
"Browsing" the Web is like ["reading" a David Markson
novel](/home/2003/12/13/i_finished_readers "What's a better verb... lucid
dreaming it?").

There is both a great tune and a car blowing up in slow motion in the video to
[Kojak, You Can't Stop It](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-rHE_yGovU "As seen
at the 115 Workplace Co-operative Christmas film night.").

All of that aside, I thought I'd switch the design of this weblog to one with
more purple, orange and old people in it, based on a design I made [for Tom
Coates, some 7 years ago](/home/2000/12/28/hey_geezers "Which he hated. But if
you have an open offer for guests to redesign your site, what do you
expect?").
