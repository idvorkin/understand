[My Life Portable Console Virtual Life
Simulator:](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Portable-Console-Virtual-
Simulator/dp/B001BLO2HY "I have one of these.") it's pink, it looks like a
rubbish Gameboy, it's an isometric first-person simulation of the life of a
teenage girl. You can chat with boys and argue with your dad.

According to the massive stats crunching of the dating site OKCupid, the best
question to ask to figure out [whether a girl will sleep with you on the first
date](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/ "OKCupid's stats blog is brilliant.") is "Do you like the taste of beer?" (By
best, I mean "most predictive.")

And: "No matter their gender or orientation, beer-lovers are 60% more likely
to be okay with sleeping with someone they've just met. Sadly, this is the
only question with a meaningful correlation for women. For men there are a few
others: _Q: In a certain light, wouldn't nuclear war be exciting?_"

Finally: videos of [waiters who are monkeys wearing doll
masks.](http://www.popbitch.com/home/2011/02/10/monkey-waiters/ "Watch
these.")
