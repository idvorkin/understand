From _The Annals of the Heechee_ by Frederik Pohl, in which the consciousness
of Robinette Broadhead (who has been "vastened" to live after death as a
machine-stored personality) is asking the simulation of Albert Einstein about
his continuity of being: "You see 'me' in the sense that you see a waterfall.
If you look at the Niagara Falls today, and come back a week later and look at
it again, you will think you're seeing the same waterfall. In fact, not one
atom of the waterfall is the same. The waterfall exists only because it is
constrained to do so by the laws of hydraulics, and surface tension, and
Newton's laws as they bear on the fact that one body of water is at a higher
elevation than another. ... The water molecules are not Niagara Falls. They
are only what Niagara Falls is made of."

The universe is the [phenotype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype "Observable expression of the genotype, the environment, and history.") of
physics.
