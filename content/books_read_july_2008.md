Books read July 2008, with date finished:

If, [like 2007](/home/2007/12/26/i_completed_reading "Last year's books
read."), I want to read 104 books this year, I should've hit 61 by the end of
July. I made 62, but I'm not making so much time for it right now so we'll see
what happens.

_101 Things_ got my brain fizzing and has given me language for ideas I've not
been able to articulate before. But this month (I like to recommend one book a
month), _Stand on Zanzibar_ is well worth your time: it's a collage of quotes
and narrative, out of which a story about an over-populated world slowly
emerges. It's like watching a cloud form, or walking past [Quantum
Cloud](/home/more/dome/images/quantum.jpg "Gormley's sculpture in which the
figure is only visible as you move past it.").
