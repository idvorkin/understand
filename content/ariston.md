# An Ariston TV spot from the early 1990s

It’s Friday evening so nothing highbrow. Time to share one of my favourite TV
ads.

This ad is for Ariston washing machines and it’s from the early 90s. It’s a
stylised domestic scene where characters enter, perform their bit, and exit.
Only each character is on a loop, all differently timed, and over the ad (the
long version runs longer than 2 minutes) the layers build and build.

I love it because it plays with polychronic time, it’s like a Michel Gondry
music video or a Punchdrunk show. It’s dense and visually compelling. I can’t
look away.

I discovered from the YouTube comments two things:

The chiptune-style music is, bizarrely enough, [the theme from the Gameboy
version of RoboCop](https://youtu.be/rhZBDNQ3gas).

Second: the ad is “based” on a video art piece called **Tango** by Zbigniew
Rybczyński from 1980. [Watch Tango here.](https://youtu.be/u0pEpA_Y1a4) (I say
_“based”_ because you never know with marketing where you are on the spectrum
between “commissioned the original artist” and “ripped off”.)

It’s all there: the single domestic room with the polychronic characters. The
collage/cut-up feel to it all. Yet this Rybczyński piece is from 1980 – that
must be practically inventing what the medium of recorded video is all about.

The Ariston spot is still gorgeous though.

[Here’s another Ariston commercial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/So5UswFSPtc)
which sounds like an accented _Ian Dury & the Blockheads._ It somehow manages
to pull off rhyming "Three hundred servicing persons" and "Mega strong
construct-i-on."

TV ads used to be art.

**Update 26 Oct.** Peter Gasston [tells me on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/stopsatgreen/status/1320332998986924032) that the
music is that second Ariston ad "was based on the song Da Da Da, by German New
Wave band, Trio." It’s awesome. [Watch it here.](https://youtu.be/XiQqzM6vsc4)
