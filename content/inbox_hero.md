[List of quotes from Ayn
Rand.](http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/432.Ayn_Rand "At Good Reads.")

Rand developed the philosophy of
[Objectivism,](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)> "Wikipedia page.") in which the pursuit of one's individual happiness and
productive achievement is the highest moral purpose.

One should not depend on nor sway to others.

Rand: "The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop
me."

Anyway, I've been thinking about an email app built on a principle of
Objectivism. At the moment, my email client defaults to doing nothing, and I
must intervene to create action (ie, write a reply).

But if I had an Objectivist email app, it would automatically respond to all
emails with stock enabling and forceful replies after a period of (say) 15
minutes, and I would have to intervene if I wanted it to _not_ do that.
