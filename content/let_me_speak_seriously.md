Let me speak seriously for a moment. As my parents die and my grandparents
die, I feel progressively cut adrift. They precede me. They tethered me to the
past, to the bedrock behind. We see the world in fives: two generations back,
our children, and our children's children, and ourselves. Time is a little
planet with close horizons. I find myself in the middle generation, almost cut
loose with a single rope now. Let go. And it's my job to carry the torch and
god help me if I stumble, because I'm it now, those towering experiences
behind me have passed the baton on, and that's the burden of the middle. I
don't have children and until I do it's a marathon to the far shore, a hard
march every step hard won, to clasp hands finally with the next generation who
will clasp hands with the next, and they'll steady me, I'll have done my job
and I'll be pulled along to the future.

I know a fellow who met a fellow whose mother makes garden gnomes, and when
his father died, his mother made a gnome out of the ashes and she keeps it in
the front garden of the family home.
