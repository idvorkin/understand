# New interview

[John Pavlus](https://twitter.com/johnpavlus) interviewed me about code… how I
got into it, what I think it does to and for society, etc. The result is this
article, [For Designers, Learning To Code Isn’t A Yes-No
Question](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3054659/for-designers-learning-to-code-
isnt-a-yes-no-question) featured at [Fast Company
Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com).

Included! My early spiritual experience with transistors. Ted Nelson’s
amazingly prescient observation that "Whatever it may do in the real world, to
the computer program, it’s just another device" and the dehumanising effect
technology can have. The steamroller approach of the coding mindset on the
world’s problems… and it’s power too.

I’m delighted with this. For some reason, conversations with John always lead
to interesting places - places I don’t think either of us (well, me
definitely) would have reached without talking together - and it’s neat to
have some of those endpoints written down.
