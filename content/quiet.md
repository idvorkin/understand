Quiet. Preparations for my upcoming trip have meant a race to the finish on
several tasks, with the consequence that everything nonessential is being
dropped to the wayside. This has led me to notice a third way I get things
done:

One of my activities is reading [Essential Cell
Biology](http://www.garlandscience.com/textbooks/081533480X.asp "Accessible
with great illustrations. High recommended."). (Yes, I regard reading which is
not related to work as essential. And if I don't finish it before I go, I'll
lose the tenuous understanding I need to complete it.) Reading about cell
biology is reading the best whodunnit: we start with the cell working
downwards - to proteins, metabolism, meiosis, ATP - and working up, to people.
I'm beginning to hit the magical moments of the loop closing, where the top
and bottom link up: oh, so _that's_ why I eat!; oh, so _that's_ what
breathing's all about! The Krebs citric acid cycle, with the lead pipe, in the
ballroom! And the denouement is life itself, there in-front and inside of me,
while I'm reading on the Tube.
