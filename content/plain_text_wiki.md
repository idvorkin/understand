Plain text wiki:

I'm a big fan of [VoodooPad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ "Mac desktop
wiki."), the Mac desktop wiki application. It presents you with a good text
editor, and a bunch of formatted text documents linked together in the
UsualWikiWay (also some really innovative scripting hooks). I like wikis
because my problem is not noting down loads of associated ideas (so I don't
need mind mapping software)--my problem is linearising, and wikis really help
me with putting down everything I'm thinking about, and massaging it into a
talk, or project presentation, or whatever.

Here's my one problem with VoodooPad: The data is in a proprietary format.
I've had computers long enough to know that I want my data in a format used by
many, many applications over many, many years. So I use VoodooPad for
arranging and notes I don't need to keep, and make sure my final presentation
notes also exist as text files.

To be honest, the most important part of a wiki for me is the _wiki_ \--I'm
not bothered about formatting or pictures. How about a plain text wiki? So
that's what I've made.

The plain text wiki is implemented as a bundle inside
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/ "Mac text editor."), the (highly extensible)
Mac text editor. To use it, I do this:

This is exactly what I need: A bunch of text documents that I'll be able to
read at any point in the future, in a wiki structure that will be simple to
implement in most extensible text editors. There are a bunch of things still
to do (some helper command to create a new wiki folder would be great, and
also to give different formatting to the words if the wiki page doesn't exist
yet), but this is my first TextMate bundle and I'm not sure how to do those
yet.

Anyway, there's barely anything there... but if you want it, feel free to
download. Grab the [Plain Text Wiki bundle](/home/more/2007/05/textmate-wiki/ "My pretty rubbish plain text wiki for TextMate.") (get the zip; it's unpacked
there too so you can browse) and double click to install. Patches welcome!

**Update:** Hey, I want to clarify something here. I love VoodooPad and won't
stop using it. I like it even more now [Gus Mueller has pointed out how to
make it save in plain
text](http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2007/05/voodoopad_s_file_format.html "VoodooPad can be made to save in plain text."). There's also room in my life
for this super simple, plain text wiki directory thing, because I know its
wikiness can be easily implemented again in the future. But 'proprietary,' as
a word, is a strong one, making things appear black and white, and I used it
recklessly. I'm sorry about how I put together the blog post above.
