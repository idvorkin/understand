# Upcoming travel: SF w/c Mon 5 Feb

A date for your diary – I’m in San Francisco/the Bay Area the week of Mon 5
February.

Lmk if you can sneak me in anywhere to see cool and unlikely things.

Mainly I would love to catch up with old friends and grab coffee with new
ones. You know my interests by now… AI, hardware, tools for thought,
multiplayer, weird software, interstellar generation ships, that sort of
thing. Drop me a note.

Though I do have one specific ask:

I’m staying in the city.

If there’s any art I should see, I’d love to hear about that.

I’m planning on getting a car one day to stretch my legs somewhere over the
bridge. Apparently there are some good loops over there. Not sure what day
yet. I know that I’m in Palo Alto on Tuesday.

The excuse for the trip is Soc Sci Foo Camp hosted by O’Reilly, Meta, and
SAGE, starting Friday 9th. Looking forward to saying hi if you’ll also be
there.

Thanks!
