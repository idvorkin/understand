Books read January 2011, by date finished:

The first third of _Journey into Space_ is wonderful and poetic.

Kuniavsky's _Smart Things_ is a comprehensive, bullet-proof, accessible guide
and compendium of approaches to the entire ubiquitous computing sector. If
you're designing smart things, it's a must-read. If you're theorising in the
area, it's a must-cite.
