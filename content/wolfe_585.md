# Wolfe+585

Every so often at work, we invite everyone we know to the pub and have a night
of drinks. Each BERG Drinks has a theme on the invite: this most recent one
was to celebrate the birthday of [Wolfe+585,
Senior,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe%2B585,_Senior) so called because
he has the longest personal name ever used. It’s in German, you can go read it
if you like.

But if you dig around, you can find a [translation of Wolfe+585’s full
name](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/permalink/worlds_longest_surname/)
into English, which is:

Adolph Blaine Charles David Earl Frederick Gerald Hubert Irvin John Kenneth
Lloyd Martin Nero Oliver Paul Quincy Randolph Sherman Thomas Uncas Victor
William Xerxes Yancy Zeus Wolfe Schlegel Steinhausen-Bergedorf "who before
ages were conscientious shepherds whose sheep were well tended and diligently
protected against attackers who by their rapacity were enemies who 12,000
years ago appeared from the stars to the humans by spaceships with light as an
origin of power, started a long voyage within starlike space in search for the
star which has habitable planets orbiting and whither the new race of
reasonable humanity could thrive and enjoy lifelong happiness and tranquility
without fear of attack from other intelligent creatures from within starlike
space" Senior.

So there you go.
