# Why I’m bullish on Twitter

My take is Twitter has three killer opportunities, invented by users and,
apart from the first, ignored by the company itself.

Everyone else seems to be chipping in on what Twitter should be doing, so this
is me joining in. Those three opportunities:

Breaking news, customer service, TV. I don’t say these because they’re places
Twitter could _possibly_ go. I point them out because users have _already_
demonstrated that this is how Twitter works for them, and because Twitter’s
competitors aren’t there. (Yet.)

I’m bullish on Twitter because these opportunities are obvious, and Twitter
Moments and the recent leadership changes hint that maybe they’re ready to
take the advantage.
