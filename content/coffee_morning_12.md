# Hardware-coffee morning next week?

Let’s do another hardware-ish coffee morning! Next week.

**Thursday 29th October, 9.30am for a couple of hours, at the[Book
Club](http://www.wearetbc.com/) (100 Leonard St).**

Why? Because it’s been A TRILLION YEARS. Something about summer totally
knocked out my routines. Plus all that cricket on the TV. Reduced my
efficiency somewhat. The last hardware-ish coffee morning was in San
Francisco, I’m still due to write that up.

Anyway [here’s how it
works](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/01/22/coffee_morning_5) but the
short version… it might be five of us, it might be fifteen, we’re all vaguely
interested in hardware startups, or making things, or knitting.

There’s no structure, no single conversation, it’s super super informal. Come
along! And we have an alarming tendency towards the meetup group cosmic death
known as TOO MANY DUDES – so if you’re NOT a dude, please take take this as an
enthusiastic invitation. Don’t let me sit there with a half dozen men on a
Thursday morning for two hours.

Bring a prototype if you fancy showing it round, but no pressure. Always nice
to have some stuff to look at.

See you then!
