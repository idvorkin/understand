# Interconnected is 20 years old today

20 years is pretty old for a blog, right? Although nowadays I “blog” more to
my daily work notes or my “draft posts” folder than I post here.

I actually have a post I’m working on. But, as is typical, it’s getting longer
and longer each time I touch it, and (I know how this movie goes) it’ll
probably soon get to the point where I think it’s too boring, too asinine, or
too wrong to do anything with. So no promises on that front.

Instead [here’s a rambling post from 2007](/home/2007/12/28/wrapping_up_2007),
from before I got self-conscious.

If you’re looking for some good sci-fi, try **Unholy Land** by Lavie Tidhar (I
kind of don’t want to point at a review but [if you
insist](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665308878/this-unholy-land-may-not-
even-be-real)). The book I am currently most excited about reading is the new
short story retrospective from [Molly Gloss](https://www.mollygloss.com),
**Unforeseen** – I have the paperback on pre-order. In the meantime, read her
novel [Wild Life](https://www.mollygloss.com/wild-life) (there’s a decent
blurb behind that link). Both of these books deal with subtle uncertainty and
unstable realities. Much of _Wild Life_ takes place in silence. Gloss writes
about silence beautifully.
