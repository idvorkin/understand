[Music for shuffle mode, by Matthew Irvine
Brown:](http://www.irvinebrown.com/?p=538 "Brilliant project.") "a series of
short, interlocking phrases (each formatted as an individual MP3) that can be
played in any order and still (sort of) make musical sense." There's a video
of it playing in iTunes. Genius. (Disclosure: I have the pleasure of [working
with Matt Brown.)](http://berglondon.com/studio/matt-brown/ "Designer at
