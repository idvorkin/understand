# After I die

This is a bit morbid I suppose but I’ve been thinking about what I’d like done
with me after I die (which won’t be for a good long time, touch wood).

When I imagine the brain, I think that “me” is its structure, and its
electrical and chemical signalling. “Me” is also my brain as embodied in my
meat, and I can imagine the structure and the dynamics of that too. My
structure - of my body and my brain - changes continuously, as I grow and
change, and as I learn and have experiences.

When I imagine the dead me, I imagine a body with a brain which is thinking
really, really slowly. As my body and my brain decompose, these are simply
changes in the structure – so decomposition would feel like learning and
developing, in some sort of way. And as adjacent neurons break down and affect
one-another, or as a worm burrows its way through my dead brain, maybe these
would feel like occasional thoughts.

And so, during this time, the pattern which is my consciousness becomes
absorbed into the pattern which is the world, and mingles with structures
already there, new connections are made and others broken, just as thinking
already is, and the changing me-pattern I experience as slow thoughts and slow
developments of the self, and I become part of a wide, slow, thinking earth.

That’s option one, to be buried and to decompose gently.

Option two:

I would like to be cremated, my ashes made into bread, and the bread shared
out and eaten by all my friends. I think that would be wonderful.
