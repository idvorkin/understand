30 year prediction:

By 2037, China, by virtue of their ability to [see and manage environment
impact](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/288/5474/2135?maxtoshow=&ck=nck&HITS=10 "China see bad consequences of deforestation; China does something about it.")
on a larger scale than other countries, will have invented [cheap renewables
to reduce their dependancy on fossil
fuels](http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0327/062.html "The richest man
in China has identified the need for cheap renewable energy, and is doing it.
Not Chinese though, which is a shame."), and will be working on fixing the
atmosphere (perhaps they'll also have genetically engineered rafts of algae on
the Pacific, excreting plastics). The West will rely on Chinese innovation to
dig us out of our ecological mess.

Just as the West will be a secondary market for Chinese consumer goods,
[BRIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC "Brasil, Rossiya, Bharat Ganarajya,
Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo.") being central, our prime-time TV entertainment
will be dubbed [Indian
television](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/business/yourmoney/11india.html?ex=1328850000&en=eb7d777f3201ab70&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss "There's a golden age of Indian television going on.") which will be written
and produced better than anything we can make domestically, yet - like our
clothes that are always 12 months behind the global styles, and our cooking
utensils that aren't really optimised for the kind of food we eat - will leave
us feeling strangely culturally decentred.
