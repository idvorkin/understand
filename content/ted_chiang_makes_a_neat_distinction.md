Ted Chiang makes a neat distinction between science and magic in [this
interview:](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/07/22/ted-chiang-interview.html "Interview with Ted Chiang on BoingBoing.")

"Science fiction and fantasy are very closely related genres, and a lot of
people say that the genres are so close that there's actually no meaningful
distinction to be made between the two. But I think that there does exist an
useful distinction to be made between magic and science. _One way to look at
it is in terms of whether a given phenomenon can be mass-produced._ [...] I
think magic is an indication that the universe recognizes certain people as
individuals, as having special properties as an individual, whereas a story in
which turning lead into gold is an industrial process is describing a
completely impersonal universe. That type of impersonal universe is how
science views the universe; it's how we currently understand our universe to
work. The difference between magic and science is at some level a difference
between the universe responding to you in a personal way, and the universe
being entirely impersonal."

Chiang's short story collection, [Stories of Your Life and
Others,](http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/chiang.html "Run-down of the
stories.") is top-notch. The title story is available online: [Story of Your
Life.](http://web.archive.org/web/20070403123150/http://heptapod.org/storylife.html "Story of Your Life, Ted Chiang.") It's told by a woman to her daughter, about
her life and an alien language that works kinda sideways to time. Definitely
put aside a half hour to read this.
