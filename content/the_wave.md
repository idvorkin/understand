# Where the wave finally broke

From _Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas:_

History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without
being sure of ‘history’ it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now
and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine
flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never
explain, in retrospect, what actually happened . . . There was madness in any
direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down
101 to Los Altos or La Honda . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was
a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we
were winning . . . And that, I think, was the handle-that sense of inevitable
victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we
didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in
fighting-on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the
crest of a high and beautiful wave . . . So now, less than five years later,
you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right
kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark-that place where the wave
finally broke and rolled back.
