Do nanometers help?

(I found a file on my computer with the above title. Pages 215-218 of _what?_
The notes are probably from when I was researching [Making
Senses](http://interconnected.org/notes/2006/06/reboot8/senses/) back in 2006…
but the actual source? Possibly _Folk Taxonomies in Early English_ (Anderson).
Dunno. Anyway, here are my favourites.)

**Black**

**White**

**Red**

**Green**

**Blue**

Also, hyper-red.

Synaesthesia is when you, for example, “see” the printed number 5 as green,
and 2 as green. Or hear C-sharp as blue. I _swear_ I remember reading about an
experiment where - when a synaesthesiac sees the number 5 as red - the number
5 is _also printed in red._ And the resulting colour: HYPER-RED.

But I’ve been combing [The Phenomenology of
Synaesthesia](http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/R_H-follow-up.pdf) (Ramachandran
and Hubbard) which is the go-to paper on such questions (for example, "Does it
matter whether the letters are upper or lower case?" Yes it does)… and I can’t
find anything. Am I mis-remembering?

Finally: [A list of fictional
colours.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_colors) "Plaid is
one of the colors outside of the natural human spectrum visible to large
intelligent arachnids in Vernor Vinge’s novel _A Deepness in the Sky._"
Cracking book that.
