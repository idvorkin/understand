There's a lovely collection of numbers from Jeff Dean at Google, about how
long common computer processor and network operations take. Data on the same
chip takes, at its quickest, only 0.5ns to look up (half a billionth of one
second). Data in computer memory takes 100ns (200 times as long) to pull onto
the chip. Data in the same building takes a million times as long; data across
the Atlantic will take 300 millions times as long. [Here are the
numbers.](http://www.regexprn.com/2009/12/numbers-everyone-should-know.html "Link to the original source.")

What makes this more human is [this
comparison,](http://loci.cs.utk.edu/dsi/netstore99/docs/presentations/keynote/sld023.htm "How Far Away is the Data?") which reveals a little bit about computer time:
your equivalent to a computer looking up data from a chip is remembering a
fact from your own brain. Your equivalent to a computer looking up data from a
_disk_ is fetching that fact from _Pluto._ Computers live in a world of
commonplace interactions not the size of a house, like us, but the Solar
System. On their own terms, they are long, long lived, and vast.
