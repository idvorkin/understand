[Edward Mordrake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Mordrake "Wikipedia is
awesome.") "was reportedly the 19th century heir to an English peerage. _He
supposedly had an extra face on the back of his head, which could neither eat
nor speak, although it could laugh or cry._ Edward begged doctors to have his
"demon head" removed, because, supposedly, it whispered horrible things to him
at night, but no doctor would attempt it. He committed suicide at the age of
23." (Via [read more wikipedia.)](http://www.readmorewikipedia.com/ "I am
