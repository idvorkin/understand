[Benoit Mandelbrot Fractal Art Contest 2007,
winners.](http://www.fractalartcontests.com/2007/winners.php "Fractals are
good.") Next year I'm going to enter a photo of a rainforest and claim I just
hit on the correct
[l-system](http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/land/OldStudentProjects/cs490-94to95/hwchen/ "The most beautiful fractal is the universe.") parameters.

[A random
tree.](http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2007/07/yggdrasil_3d_wo.html "Yggdrasil, in PaperVision (Flash).")

[SpeedTree](http://www.speedtree.com/ "Software component.") is a software
component to procedurally generate, light and render vast forests of trees in
real-time. What I would give for a slowly panning, generative, Mac desktop
background of the [Trees of
Pangaea](http://www.speedtree.com/html/pangaea_main.htm "SpeedTree demo.
Seriously, watch the movies."), the species mix of which would respond to my
shifting [continuous partial attention](http://schulzeandwebb.com/2005/cpa/ "S&W project, 'Attention Fader,' which represents calls on your attention with
changing, static images.").

[Dynamic traffic simulator](http://www.traffic-simulation.de/ger "Java.").
Click 'Zufahrt' and see the pressure wave propagate backwards through the
traffic jam from the on-ramp. I could watch these simulations for hours. See
also [the shortcut](http://bewitched.com/m/ "Now this I have watched for
hours.").

[VATSIM](http://vatsim.net/ "Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network.")
networks people all over the world to simulate air traffic control together.
This is a service provided to people using flight simulator software, via
plug-ins. [TerraNova have a good thread on
this.](http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/11/lights_will_gui.html "Arguments about whether people want to do labour.") When [Wired covered sim
ATC in 2003](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.03/dull.html "Back when I
was buying the magazine."), they mentioned a curious failure mode: "O'Hare was
having four emergencies a night, and they don't get four a month in the real
world. They'd call the tower and say, 'Emergency! Engines out.' I know what
people are doing: Maybe they need to go eat dinner, so they call in an
emergency so they don't have to wait in a holding pattern to land."

Ageing superheroes. Who was I talking about this with? An old folks home for
superheroes would need to be stocked with the equivalents of incontinence
pants for the special forms of excretions these people have. Like Superman
would have leaky heat ray vision the whole time, and everything in-front of
him would get mildly toasted. And Green Lantern would have little accidents
where the [power ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ring_%28weapon%29 "Although he would have to keep it charged.") would make manifest glowing
greens pairs of slippers and cups of tea. Or I suppose he could just take it
off.

Omar Elsayed's website, [dessalles.com](http://dessalles.com/ "Experience
designer at Schematic."), is utterly gorgeous: a Google Maps satellite view
drifts in the background. I left the window open all day, and it wound up over
a handsome desert somewhere. Like being in a hot air balloon, lost and rapt in
the baking heat. He also gives a smart response to my question, [how to design
a sign-in system for a group](/home/2007/12/28/wrapping_up_2007#twentythree "'How would you design a sign-in system for a book club?'"), switching the
focus from authentication to permissions. I like this approach, for a TV that
tracks usage for multiple users: "let anyone can use any profile they wish and
instead protect the ability to remove content from a specific profile."

[Interrupter 1.0](http://www.thisplacement.com/2007/10/05/interrupter-10/ "A
wooden box with a switch.") is a "preliminary prototype of a device that
interrupts you while you move through the city." I have an ongoing problem
with presence - sometimes unable to feel fully in the world for days at a time

- and I value highly the moments of coming to or surfacing this device would
  provoke. So, inspired by Interrupter I've made a [presence machine on
  Twitter](http://twitter.com/presencemachine "It'll tell you to look around
you, once every 12 hours or so."): follow it, then every 5 minutes there's a
  small chance the machine will say ['Look around
  you.'](http://twitter.com/presencemachine/statuses/559605712 "Try not to think
of the tv series.") It should work out as once every 12 hours, more or less
  [[update](/home/2008/01/06/the_presence_machine "Except it didn't, for the
first few days.")], and being in the world twice a day ought to be enough for
  anyone.
