# Upcoming chances to meet in Amsterdam, Berlin, etc

So I’m heading up this [startup accelerator for IoT and connected
hardware.](http://www.rgaiot.com) Applications close 14 November. I’ve just
been in the states seeing how previous programs have run. It’s all pretty
excellent. More on that later.

Right now I’m in outreach mode. I’m meeting as many startups as possible in
order to spread the word, and to get a better sense of what the current
challenges and opportunities are.

In return, I’m happy to share my take on the business and product, make
connections to potential partners and investors where I can, and answer
questions about how this particular accelerator works.

All of this is usually quite ad hoc, but there are a few convenient times
coming up:

Of course I’m always up for meeting over coffee. Drop me a line if you want to
set something up: matt at interconnected dot org
