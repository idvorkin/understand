The current wave of Arab revolutions reminds me that the series of [Colour
Revolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_revolution "Georgia, Ukraine,
etc.") in the Balkans and ex-Soviet states (in the early 2000s) was not an
_unassisted_ wave. Rather, it might have been the work of [revolution
consultants from Belgrade known as the Centre for Non-Violent
Resistance](http://interconnected.org/home/2004/12/20/the_opposition "A blog
post of mine from 2004.") (see also the [full
article).](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa "The
Guardian, 'US campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev'")
