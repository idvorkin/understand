[Chinese mathematics, an overview](http://www-groups.dcs.st-
and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Chinese_overview.html "A unaxiomatic maths."):
"a person gains knowledge by analogy, that is, after understanding a
particular line of argument they can infer various kinds of similar reasoning
... Whoever can draw inferences about other cases from one instance can
generalise ... really knows how to calculate... . To be able to deduce and
then generalise.. is the mark of an intelligent person."

[If English was written like Chinese](http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/yingzi.htm "It's not just pictograms."): "The yingzi that use a particular radical will
form a class of their own--a sort of meaning class. We can consider the entire
English language to be divided into 214 meaning categories. For instance,
every yingzi that uses the bug radical will have something to do (at least
etymologically) with insects or reptiles. However, since the number of
radicals is so limited, and because the choice of radical is sometimes quirky,
the resulting sets will be rather vague and eccentric."

[Humans have 347 different smell receptors.](http://www.bio-
medicine.org/biology-definition/Olfaction/ "Imagine if there were 347 primary
colours.") 347 orthogonal odours.

Adam Greenfield's [Minimal
Compact](http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2008/01/19/back-by-popular-demand-the-
minimal-compact/ "Self-proclaimed goofiness is good by me.") applies the model
of different-yet-compatible Linux distributions to the simplest surface needed
for states to live side-by-side. cf.

The [Molecule of the
Month](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/index.html "Beautiful images.") "presents short accounts on selected molecules from the
Protein Data Bank. Each installment includes an introduction to the structure
and function of the molecule, a discussion of the relevance of the molecule to
human health and welfare, and suggestions for how visitors might view these
structures and access further details." Plus each is super pretty.
