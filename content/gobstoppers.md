# Gobstoppers

I’m a fan of
[gobstoppers.](http://www.keepitsweet.co.uk/product_info.php/cPath/76/products_id/1104)
(I don’t know if you get these outside the UK: solid sugar sweet for sucking,
no gum, brightly coloured.)

To manufacture a one inch gobstopper [takes two
weeks!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobstopper)

It probably takes seven minutes to eat one. Every minute you suck that’s two
days. An hour a second!
