# Eating the Sun

One way to look at it is that we’re 3.5 billion years into a race that has 7.5
billion years yet to run:

One day the Sun will consume the Earth. Or will the Earth consume the Sun?

It’s physics vs life, if you like.

_(It was the solstice this week and someone posted on Twitter," one day the
Sun will consume the Earth," so this is apropos of that.)_

Stellar evolution says that the Sun will gradually become a red giant,
transform with a rapid helium flash into a subgiant, grow again then evaporate
into a nebula with a central white dwarf. [The end of the
Sun.](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/infocom/The%20Website/end.html)

OR: humanity could develop until it becomes a Type II civilisation on the
[Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale):

A civilization capable of harnessing the energy radiated by its own large
star- for example, by means of the successful completion of a Dyson sphere or
Matrioshka brain.

In which case there’s no red giant, no helium flash, and no nebula.

Given how well astrophysicists understand the evolution of stars, I wonder if
anyone has counted white dwarfs to see if there’s the expected number? It
might be lower if there’s a lot of life out there.

So maybe we don’t need to try to spot a Type II exocivilisation directly, with
our big telescopes. Instead we could detect their presence statistically.

Ought we take sides?

Like: if you’re _not_ all in on eating the Sun for its total energy output to
drive the turbines of humanity in a giant spherical megastructure capturing
all available sunlight, does that make you a species traitor?

Secretly supporting the other team, some kind of Kim Philby of the Long Now.

Thought experiment: if you knew that your best friend was rooting for one side
or the other, as abstract and as distant as it all is, would you feel
differently about them? I think you might.
