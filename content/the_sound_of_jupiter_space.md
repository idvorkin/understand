[The sound of Jupiter space.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3fqE01YYWs "Okay, it's just electromagnetic radiation sharing the frequency that sound
does in the air. But stretch a little, eh, it's good noise.") Reminiscent of
[9 Beet Stretch](http://www.notam02.no/9/ "Beethoven's 9th, time-stretched to
24 hours. The artist emailed me, having read my weblog entry about it, but I
forgot to email back. Foon.") ([before](/home/2004/04/19/leif_inges_9_beet "I
listened to it on a long train ride.")). As 9 Beet Stretch is slowed down, I
wonder what the voice of Jupiter would be sped up.

_"Heeeelllllllllloooooooo wooooorrrrrllllldddddd."_

"Jupiter Space," eh. _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) culminates in what is
called Jupiter space (the [original
screenplay](http://www.moviescriptplace.com/main/movie/96 "And has a lengthy
explanation of the film at the end.") has Discovery head for Saturn). This of
course means there's also Earth space and Moon space, with all the bits in-
between being "outer space." The idea that planets have space hanging off them

- different spaces, like different territorial waters - seems quaintly
  planetcentric now. The viewpoint has shifted such that all the planets are
  within the very same space, located by Cartesian coordinates on a map of the
  galaxy. There is just Space. I suppose this is like the university computer
  network and the military computer network and Ford's computer network all
  coming together to make a single "the internet."

Perhaps, back in the 1960s, we all used to have our own lives too, but now
we're each living the same life but with different parameters. It's a shame.
As a metaphor it makes the idea of trying out someone else's life - of judging
them - of being in their shoes - seem possible. But it's not, not always. Our
individual lives are separated by the desert vacuum of Outer Life. I need
rocket-ships, time and bravery to visit your life, to understand you inside
your own space. And vice-versa. But it's worth it.
