The presence machine I put together [the other
day](/home/2008/01/03/benoit_mandelbrot "Mentioned at the bottom of the
post.") stubbornly refused to randomly pick its magic number for 2 and a half
days (it runs every 5 minutes, and flips a 144 sided coin. If the 100th heads
comes up, it uses [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ "Letting friends know what
you're up to.") to remind you to have a look around). The odds of that are
small--less than a penny in the pound. Overnight, however, it did fire, twice.
But Twitter appears to reject identical status updates, and so the messages
didn't get through.

I've made an update: to keep the messages different, the presence machine will
now send out a first line from Lao Tzu's _Tao Te Ching_ , [translated by
Ursula Le Guin](http://www.metrotimes.com/arts/lq/18/summer/leguin.html "Interpreted really, Le Guin doesn't read Chinese."). Sometimes it's not the
first line; I'm fickle.

[Here's the presence machine.](http://twitter.com/presencemachine "Sign up.")
Maybe something will happen soon. Maybe not.
