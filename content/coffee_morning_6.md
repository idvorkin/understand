# Coffee morning six

Hey, let’s have another hardware-ish [coffee
morning](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/01/22/coffee_morning_5)!

**Thursday 26th February, 9.30am for a couple of hours, at the[Book
Club](http://www.wearetbc.com/) (100 Leonard St).**

Do come! Usual game… zero structure, just a few like-minded people having
coffee with a vague “making things” skew. There might be two of us, there
might be ten. Probably somewhere in-between.

I _think,_ if we’re _lucky,_ that one person who’s going to come will bring
their as-yet unreleased hardware prototype. That’s what they’ve promised me
anyhow.

All welcome, it would be lovely to see you :)
