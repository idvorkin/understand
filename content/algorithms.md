# Naming algorithms and the ghosts in Pac-Man

How do we relate to the algorithm? Here’s one way…

Sproute is a navigation app that diversifies how you travel by offering a set
of characters that get you to your destination in different ways.

For example maybe you want to avoid dark and unlit streets at night, or maybe
you could go sightseeing on the way to your destination?

I met Breitenstein on one of my Wednesday calls. _(I open my calendar for a
few slots every week, for serendipity purposes. Wednesdays are now my
favourite day.[Rationale and booking link

His prototype app, [Sproute](https://www.juliusingemann.com/sproute), is a
replacement for the Google Maps routing system with a few different options,
each embodied as a character:

Great write-up of the design process at the above link.

Here’s [Chapter 4 of the Pac-Man

(2009), an enormously in-depth guide to the original 1980 Pac-Man arcade game.

It turns out that the four ghosts embody _four different pursuit algorithms_
and their descriptions in Japanese are poetic explanations of those
strategies. I’m going to dump the details of all four here because I am
forever trying to find this in my notes.

I think that when we _don’t_ name the algorithm, it’s hard for us to imagine
it could work any other way.

We imagine that the Google Maps algorithm must be the best way to get from A
to B, because it’s the only way. Like nature.

(It’s telling that, when users get more expert, they _do_ start naming
algorithms. The SEO community has names for the various Google Searches over
time.)

I don’t think we should _anthropomorphise_ algorithms – if we say that the
Facebook news feed algorithm (for example) has its own agenda, that implies it
has agency, and that obfuscates the fact that it’s actual people at an actual
company who made the decisions to have it work that way.

But names… names give us a way to have a public conversation about biases and
consequences. Names let us imagine alternatives.
