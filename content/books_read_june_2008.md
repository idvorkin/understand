Books read June 2008, with date finished:

I'm a huge fan of DeLanda. I find his language and the concepts useful
operators in thinking about work and life in general. But this is my second
run at _A New Philosophy_ and while assemblage theory hits home hard, I sense
that he plays fast and loose with his examples without moderating his language
to compensate. That makes it hard for me to take as seriously as I'd like.

_From Counterculture to Cyberculture_ tracks [Stewart
Brand](http://sb.longnow.org/Home.html "Brand's bio on the Long Now Foundation
site.")'s rather Count de Saint-Germain existence through the significant
events of the latter half of the 20th century. I enjoy this kind of history,
and in particular I have a hobby interest in the central role of cybernetics
over the last 60 years in the making of the modern world; Turner did not
disappoint.

This month my single recommendation is Levi, if only because he tells
personal, far-reaching stories, and then drops in lines like "man is a
centaur, a tangle of flesh and mind, divine inspiration and dust."

Certainly, I am a centaur.
