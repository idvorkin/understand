# How to read this blog as of Sept 2024

Hey gang, this is a rare scheduling note!

_If you get this blog as an email newsletter, I’m switching newsletter
platform. Please read on for details._

You may have forgotten who I am:

I’m Matt Webb. I’ve been writing here at interconnected.org since February 2000. Aide-memoire: [my recent projects and potted history](/).

Currently I post here approx weekly on topics such as: AI, hardware, the
weirding of tech, speculative design, and whatever I’ve been reading recently
about the Late Neolithic or asteroids or whatever.

You can get the latest posts in three ways:

I no longer auto-post updates to X/Twitter.

**If you already read this blog as an email newsletter, some changes:**

The newsletter platform is changing this coming week! This post is being sent
via Mailchimp, but Mailchimp went on the fritz last week, and for some reason
sent out the same post three days in a row before I could stop it (sorry!).

For email subscribers, all future posts will be sent using
[Buttondown](https://buttondown.com). _You don’t need to do anything._ I will
migrate the subscriber list. But check your spam folder if you don’t see any
emails more recent than this one (deadline: the end of the first week of
September). The From address will be the same: `matt+blog@interconnected.org`

The new unsubscribe link will be at the bottom of next week’s email. [Here’s
the new subscribe link](https://buttondown.com/genmon).

However you read, thanks for reading!

I rarely use images in posts. But sometimes I do, and I need to test if they
still work.

So here’s a map of the extrapolated Earth.

"The coastline of a greater world lay before my eyes…"

[Here’s my post about it from 2021](/home/2021/08/19/extrapolated).

As part of the move from Mailchimp to Buttondown, I’ve also had to re-jig a
bunch of how my email is configured. Don’t ask.

So while I would usually say, _any problems get in touch,_ there’s a decent
chance that if the new newsletter doesn’t work, my email will also be broken
completely.

Which might be a blessing tbh.

I long to be [like Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-
faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html):

I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an
email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15
years of email is plenty for one lifetime.

Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of
things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things.

hashtag life goals.
