# San Francisco hardware-ish coffee morning

Last week’s coffee morning was awesome – 20 people, a bunch of demos: music-
box software, razor handles (not all hardware is internet-connected), battery
monitoring tech for sub-Saharan Africa. Tons of chitter chatter. I promised to
send an email with a list of who was there, I’ll do that soon.

But first! Next week I’m in San Francisco, so I figured, well, we could have
one there. Let’s try this…

**Thursday 6th August, 9am-ish for a couple of hours.[Sightglass Coffee, Soma
district](https://www.sightglasscoffee.com/our-company/locations) (270 7th
Street, San Francisco.)**

[Here’s what
happens.](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/01/22/coffee_morning_5) It’s
_so_ informal, no introductions. We just find a table and talk about the
weather and the cricket. It’s nice-not-compulsory to be interested in the
hardware world… do bring a demo if you are, I’m always curious to see what’s
going on.

I’ve never been to Sightglass before. It might be terrible. I’ll try to make
the world’s tiniest sign on a post-it.

Anyway ALSO I’ll be at Foo Camp which is this coming weekend, so do say hi if
you’ll be there too.

It’d be lovely to hang out. Londoners, normal service will be resumed soon.
Keep your eyes on the [announce list.](http://tinyletter.com/coffeemorning)
