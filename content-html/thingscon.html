  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>I presented this essay as part of <a href="https://2020conf.thingscon.org">ThingsCon 2020</a> on 11 December, 2020. The week-long virtual festival was also the launch of this year’s <a href="https://www.thingscon.org/publications/the-state-of-responsible-iot-report/">Responsible Internet of Things</a> publication, so I decided to speak about imagining futures - dystopias and utopias. As a talk, the essay was shortened and I also used slides. What follows is the long-form version.</em></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Dentistry, 3D printing, and the Gartner Hype Cycle</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want to talk about the Internet of Things and how we build the future. The theme being, of course, as this is the event, responsible IoT.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Internet of Things first appeared on the Gartner Hype Cycle in 2011. <em>(<a href="https://vimeo.com/464835556">Source</a>; see linked spreadsheet for data.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Also that year:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Image Recognition. Well, that’s just how computers see now.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Also QR codes. I was rooting for you, QR codes. It only took a global pandemic to have me scanning codes every time I leave the house.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s interesting the convoluted route technologies take to adoption, and the effect they have, and to think about the Internet of Things, IoT, in that context.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">3D printing first appeared in 2007. It had a 4 years head start.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We got our first milling machine in 2006. This was at Schulze &amp; Webb, the studio that later became my old company BERG. It milled blocks of chemical wood, and produced a kind of dust that gave us <em>“tight lung”</em> as we called it then because we were young, but will probably take a year off my life when I’m old. It ran overnight to make any kind of shape. Resolution, and I’m guessing here, probably around half a millimetre.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now <a href="/home/2020/11/05/dentist">I went to the dentist</a> the other day to get a crown replaced. My mouth was scanned and the tooth designed with a handheld photogrammetry device and touchscreen 3D software on a terminal right by the chair.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It took <em>7 minutes</em> to mill my new tooth on the machine in the basement. The milling machine has an accuracy measured in microns: about a thousand times more accurate than our old miller.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Even last year, making and fitting a new crown was a 2 week job requiring a specialist lab. Now my neighbourhood dentist can do it, and I was in and out in less than 90 minutes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the way 3D printing has come into the world is what I would call: same but faster.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Faster teeth. Faster prototyping. Faster tools for injection moulding in factories.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But we haven’t seen the society-wide impact that I think some of us were expecting when 3D printing first appeared on the Hype Cycle. Supply chains haven’t turned into supply <em>webs.</em> Manufacturing hasn’t become local, with mini factories in every neighbourhood. We don’t print our phones or print our shoes or print our breakfast. We still have mass production and mass consumption and mass marketing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Don’t get me wrong. I hate going to the dentist. 3D printing means I can go to the dentist for less time. I am delighted. But what we got is nowhere near what we imagined.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So is the Internet of Things more like what we <em>got</em> with 3D printing, or more like what we <em>imagined</em> we’d get? Is it same-but-more-efficient, or is it transformative?</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The Great Inversion is midway done</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think about the Internet of Things as the <strong>Great Inversion.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It used to be, before the Internet of Things, say before it appeared on the Gartner Hype Cycle, before 2011, that the computer was contained in the world. There was the world and it contained people, and forests, and cities, and shoes, and feelings, and all the rest. And one of the things contained by the world was the internet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Because of the Internet of Things, this situation has inverted, it is inside out. There is now the computer, and one of the things that it contains is the world.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Robotics are the hands and feet of that inversion. Computer vision – that’s the eyes. But IoT, it’s the connective tissue. The wiring.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I would say that the Great Inversion is currently midway done.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a short story written by Paul Ford way back in 2002 called <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/robot_exclusion_protocol">Robot Exclusion Protocol</a>. It is <em>very</em> short, 254 words. It’s about Google. Here’s how it starts.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I took off my clothes and stepped into the shower to find another one sitting near the drain. It was about 2 feet tall and made of metal, with bright camera-lens eyes and a few dozen gripping arms. …</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“Hi! I’m from Google. I’m a Googlebot! … I’m indexing your apartment.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s the era we’re in at the moment. Indexing. Ingesting. Eating.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With IoT we’ve got industrial IoT with sensors in factories, and we’ve got connected cars, and we’ve got voice-controlled gadgets.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And what it means it that the <em>physical world</em> is now subject to all the winds and forces of the internet. Those search engine index, those trading algorithms; it’s subject to analytics and automatic optimisation and machine learning, and all the rest.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t see it slowing down. The economic imperatives are too strong.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Whatever happens to musicians happens to everybody</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What happens when <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software eats the world</a>? Bruce Sterling has a line about this. He says, <a href="https://networkcultures.org/mycreativity/2014/12/03/whatever-happens-to-musicians-happens-to-everybody-by-bruce-sterling/">Whatever Happens to Musicians Happens to Everybody</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">He talks about a collapse in genre diversity, and the distributors taking control of the economics, and go-it-alone creators. And his point is that you can see the same thing happening in newspapers and fashion and whatever. It happened first to musicians.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Because of the Great Inversion, the world is part of the internet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I’d like to generalise Sterling’s Law to this: whatever happens on the internet will happen to the world.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And there are many good things about the internet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the internet in 2020, well, we’re not in a good place. Despite the idealism of those who wrote the RFCs when the internet was in its infancy, and the good intentions those who who were at the vanguard of Web 2.0 when the internet came into the mainstream.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Not in a good place at all.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Platform capitalism and consumer farming</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like any complex system, the internet comes with internal forces that shape its evolution. Forces, tendencies, gravities. Call this <em>internet realism.</em> I call  these forces <em>“logics”</em> because they are directions that just <em>make sense</em> within the context of the internet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One is the logic of platform capitalism.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Platform capitalism is a term invented by the economist Nick Srnicek. <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/platform-capitalism/9781509504879">His book is great.</a> He uses it to label the operating model of many Big Tech corporations, and <a href="https://www.ippr.org/juncture-item/the-challenges-of-platform-capitalism">he points out that they work like this</a>:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Operate a marketplace that brings buyers and sellers together. For example, book sellers and book customers. Or drivers and passengers. Or advertisers and browsers</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Collect data - any data - all the data - that can be used to drive marketplace activity, either by pushing transaction volume or marketplace size.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As the marketplace grows, it wins out over other, alternative marketplaces, reducing competition. And the data capture basin increases too, enabling further growth. As part of this step of the operating model, data capture always increases.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Repeat and grow.</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You can see it in action with, say, Facebook. All my friends are there! It’s free! There’s no excuse for me not to be a participant in this marketplace. Yet the data which is gathered is used to drive my marketplace activity – my clicking on ads and my purchases. From the advertisers point of view, there’s no ability for them to opt out either. And the ads are priced at just the level where they would be foolish not to participate – but where Facebook can keep as much margin as possible. The data they gather lets them know exactly what this level is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is a hungry logic. It’s expansionist, and there’s no room to realistically consider alternatives. It just makes sense.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What happens when the logic of platform capitalism meets the Internet of Things?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We see glimpses of that with Uber, and their carefully priced marketplaces which capture drivers into vehicle rental and subsistence income. And we see glimpses of that with the Amazon Ring doorbell and data gathering on the street.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But let’s take it an extreme. I can imagine a free apartment where everyday activity is monetised. A free house that comes with a bundled app store of Amazon Dash-style subscription purchases for cleaning products, and food, and clothes, and rental furniture; all carefully and automatically optimised by monitoring usage through connected cameras and sensors.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is a dystopia where humans, you and me, are farmed as consumers, by platform capitalism. We never own, we pay rent.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It could be built today. It’s just that nobody’s gotten round to it yet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So that’s one example of where that particular logic could end up.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">To the computer, it’s just another device</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A second logic of the internet is that of abstraction.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ted Nelson invented hypertext and was one of the first to really probe what it meant to use computers for creativity. He’s a visionary. In his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">Computer Lib</a> (1974), he said this:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Whatever it may do in the real world, to the computer program it’s just another device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And this is the amazing thing about computers and the internet – the computer sends data, and it could be showing a few pixels on a screen, or it could be driving a probe on another planet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or it could be transferring Bitcoin. A Bitcoin transaction takes as much energy - and therefore as much carbon - as used by an average British household in two months.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">These all have the same weight to the computer. And so they all weigh the same to us. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The logic of abstraction is neither good nor bad, it’s just the way computing works. Everything gets abstracted. Computer scientists have a name for when you can tell what happens the other side: they call it a “leaky abstraction.” It’s something to be avoided.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But in the real world, when consequences are hidden, situations tend to be abused.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And what happens when the real world is, well, just another device, thanks to IoT?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well, you tap an app on your phone, and you call a car. The driver rents their car, is paid below minimum wage, has no savings. They’re an independent contractor so they don’t have employment benefits. At some point the workers will be automated away. The company is structured so that they are, in the parlance, “asset light” - but also so that they can’t be held accountable.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We, the tapper of the app, are insulated, because of the logic of abstraction.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s what Peter Reinhardt <a href="https://rein.pk/replacing-middle-management-with-apis">first referred to</a> as <em>Below the API</em> versus <em>Above the API</em> jobs. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Living above the API, we order groceries, interact with customer service, live our lives one step abstracted from the people with whom we share a society. And below the API, wages are squeezed, people made to compete with robots, and inequality grows.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s hard to argue with the logic of efficiency and automation. That’s what makes it a logic. The logic of abstraction is what makes it hard for us to even see it happening.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The logics of monocultures and overextended complexity</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So there are other logics of the internet. The logic of monocultures that create attack surfaces for state-sponsored cyberwar. The logic of overextended complexity that grows till breaking point. We’ve seen high-frequency trading algorithms cause flash crashes in the stock market, from just that logic of complexity – what happens when we have a flash crash on a highway of autonomous cars filled with school kids and commuters?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But enough dystopias.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Dystopia is an extrapolation. Utopia requires discontinuity</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The future I <em>want</em> embodies different values.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want my home to be voice controlled – but I want it without centralised data capture.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want car-sharing schemes and last mile delivery – but I want it to operate through mutualism and co-operatives.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want home security drones – but I want them to make their domestic visual index available to a private app so I can text-search my bookshelves for that book I can’t lay my hands on, rather than them using it to train their ad targeting A.I.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Privacy. Agency. Mutualism. Equality.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not saying these futures are impossible, but they feel hard to reach from where we are right now.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Because honestly, it feels like I don’t get to choose, <em>we</em> don’t get to choose, those futures.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The system that does get to choose is the system that surrounds our tribe of designers, technologists, and founders. It’s all those adjacent tribes that never get to see the idealism and the intentions. The marketers, retailers, supply chain experts, risk assessors, the MBAs, policy-makers, and so on. They don’t get to see the vision; they have to follow the well-trodden path. They follow the logics. The logics are the same old business models, the same old ways of capturing attention, the same old methods to build platforms.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Dystopia is the extrapolation of the same old, same old.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But utopia is a non-extrapolation, it requires a discontinuity. It requires all these different tribes to choose to do something different, at great risk to their careers and livelihoods.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If they’re going to do that, they all need to be <em>shown</em> that something different first, and shown how it’ll work.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And you know what, I think that’s our job.</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">We need to do the hard work of imagining</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Sir Terence Conran: <q>The designer’s job is to imagine the world not how it is, but how it should be.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve lost the habit of imagining utopias. Perhaps we all have.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Today, right now, we’re in what architect Bryan Boyer calls a “vision vacuum.” I don’t know why, but imagination about positive futures is scarce right now. And in the absence of a compelling narrative, the same old, same old wins by default.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Narratives? Fiction?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But we don’t need just design fictions. We need business model fictions, engineering feasibility study fictions, interop protocol specification fictions, investment return fictions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ll give you an example. I’m <a href="/home/2020/08/06/bis">a proud member of the British Interplanetary Society</a> which is, on one hand, a talking shop. But on the other, has been a significant part of the conversation, for 87 years, through engineering feasibility reports. The society’s engineering design for a probe that would go to another star, a study called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus">Project Daedalus</a> which ran from 1973 to 1978, has helped make the idea of interstellar travel more believable. Concept ships in research and fiction are based on the Daedalus designs; the Daedalus report helps identify what the actual problems are and where R&amp;D should be targeted.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I guess what I’m asking for is a different kind of think tank, not one that works with recommendations and reports and regulation, but <strong>a new think tank that trades in politically opinionated, worked examples that demonstrate, demystify, and de-risk.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The objects and systems must be plain, easy to understand, and embody our values. If you asked me now where to start, I would start with worked examples for:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Zero-user-data connected products <em>(related: I wrote about <a href="/home/2020/05/26/voice">voice control for everything</a>, but could we sketch a business model?)</em></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Open file formats for service portability  <em>(related: I wrote about <a href="/home/2020/10/14/protocols">interop for video calls</a>, but could we design the protocol and code up a reference app?)</em></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Software-enabled cooperative corporations <em>(related: I wrote about <a href="/home/2020/12/04/coops">software-enabled co-ops</a> but could we ship a co-op as a Shopify plugin?)</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_object">boundary objects</a> that transcend language and can translate across the different tribes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And the marketers, retailers, supply chain experts, risk assessors, the MBAs, policy-makers, and so on, if we can indeed make tiny, proof of concept, real versions of these futures, bonsai tree utopias, made out of spreadsheets and simulations, if we can speak to them in their words, they will nurture and help those futures grow, I think there’s space for that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think I need to - <em>we</em> need to - imagine utopias again, and we need to demand and create demand for them, and we need to articulate them in great detail.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But <em>we</em> need to be the ones doing the hard work of imagining a responsible future for the Internet of Things. Because it’s no-one else’s job to do so.</p>
