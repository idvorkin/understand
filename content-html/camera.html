  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Can you measure the velocity of concepts over a piece of text, e.g. 0.5 concepts/word?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes. Or rather, well, something like that, possibly one day soon, it’s interesting.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want to unpack that thought.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Hey, an editorial note:</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This post is for me, not for you haha</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I like to do (and what I also do for clients) is to string together weak signals and see where it takes me. I get to new places when I think out loud.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The process is… meandering. And technical. And lengthy.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So feel free to <strong>skip to the tl;dr</strong> at the bottom if you want to know where I end up.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Background: Embeddings</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s an AI-adjacent technique called <em>“embeddings.”</em> A word, or a phrase, or a paragraph is mathematically converted into coordinates. Just like a location on a map is described by lat and long.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Only the “map” in this case is a map of concepts. So if two phrases mean roughly the same thing, their coordinates are close together. If they mean different things, they’re further away.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/">Simon Willison has a great deep-dive into embeddings</a> (2023).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But let me give you an example so you can get a feel for this…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I built an embeddings-powered search engine for my unofficial BBC <em>In Our Time</em> archive site, <strong>Braggoscope.</strong> There are a 1,000 episodes on all kinds of cultural and historical topics, so it’s a good case study.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Go to <a href="https://www.braggoscope.com">Braggoscope</a> and hit search:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Search for <code class="f7 black-80">jupiter</code> – the episode about the planet Jupiter is at the top of the results</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Search for <code class="f7 black-80">the biggest planet</code> – again, the episode about the planet Jupiter is at the top. There is no synonyms database here, which is how a traditional search engine would work. The phrase <q>the biggest planet</q> has been translated into its “coordinates” and the search engine has looked for “nearby” coordinates representing episodes.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Search for <code class="f7 black-80">main roman god</code> – this is also Jupiter, but a different one: this Jupiter is the king of the gods in the Roman pantheon. The top result is an episode about Rome and European civilisation, <em>not</em> the episode about the planet Jupiter, showing that embeddings can distinguish concepts even when similarly named.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I wrote a technical deep dive on how to create this search engine back in January on the PartyKit blog: <a href="https://blog.partykit.io/posts/using-vectorize-to-build-search">Using Vectorize to build an unreasonably good search engine in 160 lines of code</a> (2024). (That post has diagrams and source code.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But what I want to emphasise is <em>how little code there is.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Embeddings are coordinates in concept-space (technically called <em>“latent space”.)</em> You get things like search for free.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But embeddings also change our relationship with text, and what we can do with text, and I just want to use this post to collect a few hints and speculations as to what that means…</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">An instrument to see the invisible semantic structure of text</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back to concept velocity.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">First, look at <a href="https://x.com/ocuatrecasas/status/1667717542784147456">this visual plot of an essay by Douglas Engelbart</a> by the user oca.computer (@ocuatrecasas) on X/Twitter (June 2023).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em><a href="/more/2024/05/embeddings/oca.computer-concept-velocity.png">Here’s a screenshot</a> if you’re not on X.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a rainbow-coloured line swooping around a 3D graph.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What is that line? We’re looking at an essay. Specially the first section of this seminal essay from computing history, <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html">Augmenting Human Intellect</a> (1962) by Douglas Engelbart.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So embeddings aren’t 2 dimensional coordinates, like the lat-long coordinations of a map. They have about a 1,000 dimensions. Obviously we have no way to visualise that. But through techniques of <em>dimensional reduction,</em> we can squash those 1,000 dimensions down to something we can see.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An analogy: your hand is 3 dimensional. You can project a shadow onto a wall. That’s dimensional reduction: the shadow is 2D. There’s some information lost, sure. For instance, you won’t be able to distinguish your fingers if your hand is side-on to the light. But it’s good enough.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The process is:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Starting with word 1, take N words of the essay (say, 20 words, I don’t know how many exactly)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Create an embedding</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Roll the window forwards: starting with word 2, take N words, create the embedding</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Repeat until you’ve done the entire essay.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Reduce the embeddings down to 3 dimensions</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Plot them on a chart, and connect them with a line. Make it a rainbow because rainbows are nice.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This visualisation has been living in my head since I first saw it a year ago.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Because it’s not just that we have a visualisation of a single essay…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>It points at a future where we can:</strong></p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">put essays side by side on the same chart, and see where their topics intersect</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">measure how fast a given piece of text moves through the space of all concepts, compared to other text</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">and observe how it twists, turns, gyres and loops back on itself.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which provokes questions:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">can individual authors be fingerprinted by how they construct text?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">in different moods, do I prefer texts that bounds along through concepts, or texts that carefully lay bricks back and forth, building up?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">could we see, actually <em>see,</em> rhetorical tricks and gaps in logic?</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Looking at this plot by @oca.computer, I feel like I’m peering into the world’s first microscope and spying bacteria, or through a blurry, early telescope, and spotting invisible dots that turn out to be the previously unknown moons of Jupiter…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There is something there! New information to be interpreted!</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>An aside on dimensional reduction:</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You can reduce approx. 1,000 dimensions to 3D, for that plot above, or 2D for <a href="https://atlas.nomic.ai/data/nomic/wiki-people/map">Nomic’s map of people in Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A friend on discord asked – can you reduce to 1 dimension? i.e. a list?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I tried it, and yes you can.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s a <a href="https://www.braggoscope.com/linked-list">linked list of episodes of BBC In Our Time</a>: each episode is closely related to the ones before and after. It’s great for browsing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For example, here’s a sequence of episode titles that transitions smoothly from geology to history:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Vulcanology</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">1816, the Year Without a Summer</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Climate Change</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Meterology</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Voyages of James Cook</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Astronomy and Empire</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Longitude</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>…and so on.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This uses PCA (principal component analysis) to find the most significant vectors, then t-SNE for the dimensionality reduction (it takes into account information in the higher dimensions to perform clustering).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s a neat trick, and thank you <a href="https://www.komoroske.com">Alex Komoroske</a> for suggesting it!</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Real-time hermeneutics</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s an adjacent idea that is actually quite different (and not to do with embeddings)…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How quickly does time move in fiction?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Answer: faster than it used to.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>The average length of time represented in 250 words of fiction had been getting steadily shorter since the early eighteenth century.</q> -= <a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2023/03/19/using-gpt-4-to-measure-the-passage-of-time-in-fiction/">Using GPT-4 to measure the passage of time in fiction</a> (2023).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em><a href="/home/2023/09/15/filtered">As previously discussed.</a></em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Check out the article for an amazing chart that shows that</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> (1719) averaged at just under a week per 250 words of narrative</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> (1952) barrels along at 10 mins per 250 words.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/more/2024/05/embeddings/ted-underwood-fiction.png">I’ve mirrored the chart here in case it goes away.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The key point is <em>acceleration.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Underwood ran the analysis twice: once with grad students, and the second time using AI.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It took the three of us several months to generate this data, but my LLM experiment was run in a couple of days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The timeframe here is 2017 to 2023.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Here’s my takeaway:</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This will be real-time, soon enough.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We’re kinda getting accustomed to the idea of real-time translation (you speak in French, they hear English) although it is still mind-blowing that this will be shipping <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">Real Soon Now with OpenAI’s GPT-4o</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But real-time text hermeneutics, unearthing the hidden meaning of text and between texts? That’s wild.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For instance, crossing this point with the previous one…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What would it mean to listen to a politician speak on TV, and <em>in real-time</em> see a rhetorical manoeuvre that masks a persuasive bait and switch?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What if the difference between statements that are simply speculative and statement that mislead are as obvious as, I don’t know, the difference between a photo and a hand-drawn sketch?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Another example of AI hermeneutics:</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back in May 2023 I gave a board talk about <a href="/home/2023/12/08/ai-pathfinding">a strategic response to gen-AI</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In that talk I put forward this speculative idea:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">extract risks from annual reports of all public firms, cluster, and analyse for new emerging risks</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The idea being that company reports have to be published, and they all include a risk register, and I bet we could see the climate crisis emerging slowly and then massively over the last couple decades… so could we pre-emptively spot <em>today’s</em> emerging risks?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Recently somebody appeared in my inbox with a project very close to this idea.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Sean Graves at the <a href="https://autonomy.work">Autonomy Institute</a> has developed a tool called <em>GERM.</em></p>
<blockquote cite="https://adu.autonomy.work/posts/2024_03_23_GERM/" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Sean Graves (Autonomy Data Unit)" data-title="GERM (Geopolitical &amp; Environmental Risk Monitor) (2024)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We used GERM to build a dataset of risks mentioned by the 266,989 UK companies who filed their accounts throughout March 2024.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">They extract risks, create embeddings, cluster them, and then analyse the resultant map.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a demo! Go read that article for a link.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ok so that’s great – but… isn’t that just data mining? We’ve had data mining for ages.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The difference, for me, is that two thresholds have been crossed: speed and automation.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It won’t be long before I can say to an AI agent: <em>hey, pull all the risks from company reports, cluster them, plot them over time, and tell me what’s emerging.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And then it won’t be long after <em>that</em> before this will happen continuously, in real-time, in the background, for everything.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">All text will be auto-glossed - textual glossolalia - it will speak about itself in a constant virtual halo.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Again I don’t know what that means, to have associations and contextualisations always present with a text, a structuralist’s dream, but… it’s different.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Photoshop for words</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So much for reading text and reading between texts. Now for manipulating text.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t fully understand how this works. I mean, I couldn’t replicate it. But I can show you the effects.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I get that embeddings are math. And that by <em>averaging</em> a collection of embeddings, you can pick out a “feature”. For example, <a href="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/yay-embeddings-math">as Amelia Wattenberger developed</a>, you can identify a quality of being “abstract” or “concrete” – and then show, for any given sentence, whether it is <em>closer</em> to being concrete or abstract.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Actually, beneath it all, in the machinery of large language models, embeddings aren’t just coordinates: they’re a collection of features.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Given a collection of features, you can <em>reverse</em> the embedding, and create text again.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">During this process, you can amplify one or more features, and <em>change</em> that quality in the text, while leaving everything else intact.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ok this is hard to imagine…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…but fortunately this is where <a href="https://thesephist.com">Linus a/k/a thesephist</a> has been digging for ages, and he made a video about it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You’ll need to sign up to X/Twitter, and it’s a 10 minute video of a prototype: <a href="https://x.com/thesephist/status/1747099907016540181">Embedding features learned with sparse autoencoders can make semantic edits to text</a> (@thesephist, 10m47s).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You should totally watch that video. But you don’t need to right now. I’ll give a small example of his tool in use, just enough to make one point.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Using <a href="https://thesephist--prism-start-app.modal.run/f/sm-v6/3888?layout=7">Linus’ semantic editor prototype</a>, I paste in the first paragraph of <em>Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> by Douglas Adams:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It embeds the text.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But instead of showing me the embedding as coordinates, a list of numbers, it gives me a list of the underlying features and how strongly they appear.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For example, feature #620 <q>Formal language and structure</q> is present.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Get this:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can now use Linus’ prototype to amplify that feature. Then re-generate the text (the prototype uses a proof-of-concept technique called <a href="https://github.com/jxmorris12/vec2text">vec2text</a>).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s what that paragraph looks like with feature #620 turned up:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unexplored Southwestern arm of the Milky Way Galaxy lies a comparatively uninteresting little outpost of a vast and undefined planet. Orbiting this small blue green-flagged epoch are a small humanoid race of people who at a mere ninety-five milliseconds are so incredibly ignorant about digital things that they really do think a digital watch is a neat idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">See the difference?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Look it’s not <em>great.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But this is super early technology. vec2text will improve.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And you already get the sense of a vibe being subtly difference. (Vibe #620 to be precise. Vibe will turn out to be a science, I swear.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Imagine it improving, as it will, and…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>In the future:</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Being able to take a chapter of a book and edit it, not by changing words, but by scrubbing it with the semantic equivalent of the burn and dodge tools in Photoshop.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like, could you colour-grade a book?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Could you dynamically change the register or tone of text depending on audience, or the reading age, or dial up the formality or subjective examples or mentions of wildlife, depending on the psychological fingerprint of the reader or listener?</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Until that moment, neither scientists nor the public knew whether or not <q>all four of a horse’s hooves came off the ground when it runs.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Imagine!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It was a controversy!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Until then <a href="https://www.amusingplanet.com/2019/06/the-galloping-horse-problem-and-worlds.html">oil paintings of galloping horses were incorrect!</a> Even in 1821, horses were wrongly depicted running like dogs.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The camera was a new instrument that showed what was already present, but inaccessible to the human eye.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So now we know how horses gallop, and how birds fly, and how people move and lift and turn (all photos taken by Muybridge).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the camera isn’t just a scientific instrument like the, I don’t know, Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">By the <em>Saturday Evening Post,</em> here are <a href="https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2022/08/5-unintended-consequences-of-photography/">5 Unintended Consequences of Photography</a> (2022):</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the camera doesn’t just observe and record, it changes us.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And then there’s Photoshop…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now we have deepfakes and unrealistic depictions of reality, and the ability to make beauty and the hyperreal. I’ll leave it to the artists to unpack that, and the effects of being able to adjust the image, and have this capability in the hands of so many, and all the rest.</p>
