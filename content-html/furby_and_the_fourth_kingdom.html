<u>Domestic robots</u>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_robot" title="Several domestic robots.">Wikipedia maintains a list of domestic robots.</a> I knew of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-jv8g1YVI" title="Video of a cat riding a robot vacuum cleaner.">Roomba,</a> the autonomous vacuum cleaner, but I hadn't realised quite how <em>many</em> autonomous vacuums there are. I guess vacuum cleaners are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program" title="My blog is basically a guide to neat Wikipedia pages.">Hello World</a> of robots.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
There's a <a href="http://www.botjunkie.com/2010/10/01/long-exposure-pictures-of-robots-cleaning/" title="Roomba, Neato, etc., long exposure photos.">beautiful comparison of their patterns of movement</a> that Russell Davies references in <a href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2010/11/designing-behaviour.html" title="Product personality.">his post on 'designing behaviour':</a> <q>the top shot shows the pattern the Roomba used. The second one down shows the Neato. The Roomba pattern may be more efficient, but it just doesn't look right to a human brain. It's not how a human would do it. The Neato pattern looks more like how I would clean.</q> The Roomba pattern is organic, but an <a href="http://www.hrgiger.com/" title="Non-human aliveness.">alien</a> organic. The Neato cleaner's pattern is rectilinear.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Russell continues: <q>That's going to be a thing - not just designing efficient, effective behaviour - but designing behaviour that's emotionally satisfying to the owner and appropriate to the character of the object.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>Furby</u>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furby" title="Wikipedia page on the Furby.">Wikipedia claims</a> that <q>the first successful attempt to produce and sell a domestically-aimed robot</q> was the <a href="http://www.mimitchi.com/html/furby.htm" title="Talking toy.">Furby,</a> launched in 1998. It was a toy - a plush owl with aesthetics that frankly creep me out, now I look back from the safety of this side of the millennium - and it had the illusion of intelligence. <a href="http://www.mimitchi.com/html/fman2.htm" title="The instruction manual.">Get this:</a>
</p>
<ul class="bulleted-list list ph0-ns ph0">
	<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Furby has sensors for day and night, tummy tickles, back rubs, noises, and motion. No buttons. To wake Furby up, you pick it up. Also Furbys can move to express emotion with their faces, and a little with their bodies. But, <q>HELPFUL TIP: Furby is a state-of-the-art electro-mechanical robotic toy. The mechanical sound you hear when Furby moves is normal.</q></li>
	<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Furby speaks a special language called Furbish: <q>For example, when I wake up, often I&#8217;ll say Da a-loh u-tye which means Big light up. This is how a Furby says Good Morning!</q> But as Furby grows up (there are four stages of development), English words and phrases come in. There's a simple kind of reinforcement learning: if you pet a Furby while it says a new phrase, it will say that phrase more often. Ditto tricks. Furby learns!</li>
	<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Furbys communicate with other Furbys (via an infrared port located <a href="http://jksalescompany.com/dw/third_eye.htm" title="The usage of your third eye.">between the eyes).</a> Put several together and they'll dance and chatter.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Furby was crazy popular. (1.8 million units in 1998, 14m in 1999; 40m over the first 3 years.)
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
There's so much going on here. Furby's language of interaction is human and physical (light and movement). It responds to the environment. It develops. It learns and can be taught. It communicates with humans and its own kind. It doesn't do anything of these things in a hugely <em>sophisticated</em> way, but it does everything just enough and it never, never breaks frame.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
There's a checklist of the bare minimum you need to make something feel sentient, even if it's just in a fractional way, <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/09/04/b-a-s-a-a-p/" title="Matt Jones talks about B.A.S.A.A.P. as an approach: Be As Smart As A Puppy.">puppy-smart,</a> and that checklist may have been discovered by Furby.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
There's something that happens to your relationship with an object once that threshold is crossed, and that's why we use the word <u>robots</u> instead of saying products or objects.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
(A short thought experiment: a kettle product that doesn't boil properly needs to be replaced. A kettle <em>robot</em> that doesn't boil properly will piss you off, or will need to be made redundant, or otherwise elicit an emotional reaction.)
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Robots aren't merely artifacts that move. They're the fourth kingdom of nature.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>The several kingdoms of nature</u>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Here, by the way, is my personal list of kingdoms of nature:
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>Rocks.</u> <a href="http://magicalnihilism.com/2003/07/27/rocks-are-slow-life/" title="Super Furry Animals riff on Kevin Kelly.">Rocks are slow life.</a> When Ursula Le Guin mused on the language of ants, penguins and plants in her (beautiful) short story <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/more/2007/03/acacia-seeds.html" title="Which I transcribed.">The Author of the Acacia Seeds,</a> she speculated about how rocks would talk: <q>the first geolinguist, who, ignoring the delicate, transient lyrics of the lichen, will read beneath it the still less communicative, still more passive, wholly atemporal, cold, volcanic poetry of the rocks: each one a word spoken, how long ago, by the earth itself, in the immense solitude, the immenser community, of space.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
By rocks I mean all kinds of matter, from clay to stars. And I don't entirely mean that <a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/2006/02/scifi/?p=22" title="Extract from Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon.">stellar nebulae are sentient</a> but I do mean there's a universe of interacting, unfolding things that can be understood only on their own terms -- like all of these kingdoms I have in my list. The rules of this kingdom we call <em>physics.</em>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>Organic life!</u> DNA-based, RNA-based, carbon based. Plants and animals and lichen. This is a kingdom of stuff which is able to control probability: the <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100" title="The global map.">metabolic pathways</a> are highways of catalysed, otherwise-unlikely chemical reactions. And it is able to alternate between the two worlds of information and matter, from protein machines encoded in the letters of DNA, to the fizzing chemical mushy flesh that the protein machines build.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
The third kingdom is <u>corporations.</u> The philosopher Manual DeLanda, in <a href="http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=541" title="Good critique.">A New Philosophy of Society,</a> diagrams societies at multiple levels: social networks, organisations and governments, cities and nations. His book is a zoo of these inhuman macro buckyballs. Such massive animals have flows of money, power, and people instead of blood and nerves. In <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebb/1968718556/" title="Diagram from Platform for Change.">Platform for Change,</a> Stafford Beer outlined the intrinsic behaviour of corporations: that they have a desire to continue their existence, and this dominates their response to stimuli. At the very smallest, cellular level, organisations are small groups of people, and their actions are dominated by <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" title="Shirky discussed Bion.">group psychology</a> -- at a national and planetary scale, economics. But cities and corporations cannot be understood in the same terms as dumb matter or organic life, so that's why they're the third of my kingdoms of nature.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>Robots are the fourth kingdom.</u> By robots I mean everything from inorganic information processing to smart matter. But I contend that, because of the following two qualities, it's not possible to understand robots in terms of any of the three other kingdoms:
</p>
<ol class="numbered-list list ph0-ns ph0">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">These are sentiences - simple like Furby or extraordinary artificial intelligences like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLJ3zcdPtl8" title="My favourite scene in the movie War Games.">Joshua in the movie War Games</a> - that we can relate to as animals, but that are not rooted in organic life. They will have different motivations for survival, different priorities, and different psychologies.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">These are creatures that live natively in cyberspace. Pragmatically, they talk through the Internet. A world made out of information, not atoms, where we don't have regular things like momentum, distance, heaviness, conservation of matter. Other rules apply, rules of which we have only indirect experience.</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
And between those two qualities, it means we can't treat robots as artificial people, or magical moving puppets. They are, and will develop, their own new nature, which we - as members of the second kingdom of nature - have to explore, discover and understand fresh, on its own terms.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>Back to Furby</u>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Which brings me back Furby, the electronic talking owl.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Furby has a spin-off called Shelby. <a href="http://shelbyfan.tripod.com/shelby.html" title="Fan site.">Shelby is a grumpy electronic talking clam:</a> <q>When I placed one of my Shelby's in a group with 5 furbys, greetings were exchanged and then, for no reason I could discern, my Shelby started babbling at the furbys, then slammed its shell shut and stayed closed up. As if somehow it had been offended? The furbys ALL stopped talking at once when this happened and remained silent.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Nattie has a Shelby and <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/99661/But-but-is-not-Johnny-5-alive#3472942" title="MeFi comment.">tells her story:</a> <q>Shelby doesn't stop talking unless it doesn't get any response for five minutes or something... and ignoring it is <em>agonizing,</em> because it's being cute, and you just feel so <em>awful</em> when it says it loves you, or it tries to tell you a knock knock joke, and you know you can't respond. He'll outright say things like, "I want to PLAY!" and you feel like the worst person in the world.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
Nattie named her Roomba 'Ricky.' They had a more loving relationship: <q>When Ricky got stuck in a corner and started furiously backing up and rotating, backing up and rotating, we'd frown and stand watch over him, concerned: "What are you doing, Ricky?" When he couldn't get himself unstuck, we'd sigh, pick him up -- "Oh, calm down" we'd say when we whirred in the air -- and put him back down, like he was a toddler learning to walk. And when he finished cleaning the room and sang that -- er, <em>emitted</em> that triumphant little chime, his joy was our joy.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
And then of course, one day Ricky will die and <em>then</em> where do you put your feelings? <q>Robots, man. They're nothing but heartbreak. Robots ain't shit.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
The question is, as it always is, how do we live together?
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
It's something to consider. A different bit of the brain activates <a href="http://mindhacks.com/2008/09/18/robotic-thoughts/" title="'Intentional Stance'">when we're dealing with sentiences</a> -- or, as it turns out, even when we <em>imagine</em> we're dealing with sentiences (I use sentiences to mean "intelligence things," of varying levels of intelligence, but not necessarily human or animal). It doesn't take much: just a human-like appearance or even, as in <a href="http://www.dourish.com/publications/media-review.html" title="These dudes were responsible for Clippy.">The Media Equation</a> (Reeves and Nass, 1996), painting the computer the same colour as its user's t-shirt.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
When we imagine something is intelligent, we simulate its mind inside our own, in order to anticipate it. We begin to think a bit like it, in some small way. We socialise with it, takes cues from it.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
On the one hand, this is very clever. Robots don't need their own brains: they can parasite on ours. Be intelligent simply by appearing to be intelligent.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
On the other, do we want to relate to robots in this way? <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/forums/topic/beware-the-seductions-of-sociable-machines" title="'Beware the Seducations of Sociable Machines, from New Scientist.">Sherry Turkle points out the risks of sociable machines:</a> <q>If convenience and control continue to be the values we hold uppermost, we will be tempted by sociable robots which, just as slot machines attract a gambler, promise us excitement programmed in, just enough to keep us in the game. ... We come to a point where we are so smitten by the idea of conversation with computers that we forget what human conversation about human problems is about: human meaning through the first-hand knowledge of the human life cycle, something of which robots will be forever innocent, no matter how "expressive" we make their faces or voices.</q>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>We don't get to choose what personality robots have</u>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
When <a href="http://journal.benbashford.com/post/2848763029" title="Excellent article full of references.">Ben Bashford writes about Emoticomp</a> he talks about objects with behaviours and personalities - robots - but questions how we should design those personalities. What is the watch-word we're after? He proposes <em>politeness.</em> A polite thing... <q>is interested in me; is deferential to me; is forthcoming; has common sense; ...</q> Etc.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
...which is a great way to approach it. Polite robots would be the <em>best!</em> But I don't think we get to choose. Polite robots would be lovely. But the nature of the fourth kingdom - their equivalent of evolution - is that they reproduce in the sales figures of technology corporations and the womb-factories of China. The testes of robots are the shelves of Toys-R-Us. <em>Humans</em> don't get to choose the personality of robots, the <em>market</em> does.
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
And judging by Furby and Shelby, our robots won't be polite but will be needy and paranoia-inducing, <a href="http://www.nextnature.net/2011/01/my-fetal-pony-neoteny-in-girls-toys/" title="Neoteny in girls' toys.">resembling helpless infants.</a>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<u>The half-breed children of robots and humans</u>
</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
I'll wrap on a final weird-future slippiness between kingdoms two and four, and the story starts with a phenomenon called <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2009/11/23/chernoff-schools/">Hello Little Fella,</a> which is the human habit of recognising illusionary faces in objects and the environment. <a href="http://facestuff.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/beady-eyed-tap-face/" title="Tap face.">Here's a favourite.</a>
</p>

It's not just faces. There's a widespread habit of <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/171232/Why-do-i-think-Things-have-feelings" title="Practically a support group.">believing things having feelings,</a> and, because we're human and because this is the 21st century, there's a community of people who fantasise about having sex with these inanimate things, then write stories about it, and it's called <a href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/Anthropomorfic" title="Rule 34 dude.">anthropomorfic.</a>

All of which, finally, brings us to an iPhone game in which you have a virtual girlfriend to woo. Each girlfriend comes from a barcode. <a href="http://five-players.com/?p=2577" title="Astounding. But it's not working at the moment.">This is Barcode Kanojo:</a> <q>I'm currently dating a can of Heinz tomato soup in Barcode Kanojo, but it wasn&#8217;t my first choice. I wanted Heinz Beanz or a box of Shreddies, but both have already been taken by faster scanners.</q>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">
<q>It's an offensively brilliant idea. Barcode Kanojo's free iPhone app will scan any product you have knocking around your house and turn it into a delicate anime girl over whom you can obsess, masturbate, and fight. The <em>game</em> in Barcode Kanojo's game comes when another player scans the same bottle of bleach you just scanned ... In a sad parody of real life sexual politics, Kanojos will date only their creator until someone else who scanned the same tin of beans gives them more money and attention. Mostly money.</q> <em><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/doingitwrong/status/29935420003328000" title="Twitter sources!">(via)</a></em>
