  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Upcoming event in London: I’m going to be speaking about <em>the Internet of Things, security, and privacy</em> with <a href="https://sarah.gold">Sarah Gold, CEO of IF</a>at <a href="https://machinesroom.co.uk">Machines Room</a> (an awesome east London makerspace), <em>tomorrow.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Insecure Futures: Privacy, Security and Connected Devices</strong> (Weds 1 Nov, 6pm): <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/insecure-futures-privacy-security-and-connected-devices-tickets-38504445834">RSVP here.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The event is part of a series of panels curated by Machines Room and <strong>Kickstarter</strong>. Sarah and I will be doing this as a “fireside chat.” Should be thought-provoking – these are some chewy topics, and Sarah is an expert. <a href="https://projectsbyif.com">Her consultancy</a> researches trust, policy and design for clients with Google and Facebook with output both practical and speculative.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We’ve each been asked to spend 5-10 minutes at the beginning of the session to <em>set out our stand,</em> so to speak. So this is my current draft on what I’m going to say. Comments welcome; I’ll evolve it some before speaking.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>On IoT, security, and privacy. But security first:</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let me say a few words about security first. Then privacy.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And really, because we’re talking about the Internet of Things, we’re talking about the security of a device in people’s homes and in businesses, what we’re talking about is the security of data and other devices on the trusted networks in those places.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With my investor hat on, a startup that doesn’t take security seriously is obviously a problem because it’s saving up problems down the road – it will be harder to acquire, and it has the potential of being part of something catastrophic.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For me, one <em>tell</em> around this - a technology red flag - is when companies build their own stack themselves for secure connection of devices to user accounts (called provisioning), or for performing over-the-air (OTA) updates. These two are bellwethers: if something isn’t right here, it’s likely that security hasn’t been considered elsewhere in the stack.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s easy to convince yourself, as a startup, that there is no solution out there that meets your needs for provisioning and updates. But over the last 12 months, the technology stack for connected devices has matured. And honestly, these stacks come with features that you will never get round to building yourself. So it’s worth looking for existing solutions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://resin.io">resin</a> is an interesting example of a useful stack. One of the things <em>resin</em> makes easy is over-the-air updates for device software. But because some of their users run this software for drones, they <em>also</em> include a feature that allows the drone to postpone the software update until it has safely landed. That’s a useful feature. Let’s say you’re building a cash register: it would be great to have a feature where it can postpone updates till after the lunch rush is over. That’s the same thing. But will you get round to building it yourself? Probably not.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So building your own stack is hard to get right, and more importantly it’s expensive to keep up to date. Over months, as the technology landscape evolves, a resource constrained startup may find itself lagging. And that’s where security problems emerge.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Building your own artisan stack feels like an expensive indulgence in most cases. The line to keep in mind is Werner Vogal’s maxim - Vogal the CTO of Amazon - his maxim of <q>no undifferentiated heavy lifting.</q> That is, don’t put significant engineering resource into stuff that isn’t your core business.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But security isn’t just technology. It’s design.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s what you encourage users to do. A friend of mine in San Francisco had some smart lighting and smart plugs some years ago. It has this great feature where if you’re on the same wi-fi network, it automatically associates the devices with your app so you can control them. And then, even when you’re not on the network, you can turn the lights on and off. Handy.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So some months after staying with my friend, I discover - from London, while demoing the app - that I can turn on the lights in his front room. I discover this because he texts me, after I’ve been doing this for some weeks, to ask if it’s me turning on and off his lights at 4am. Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Of course I reckon with this power I can possibly start a fire. Lights on and off as quick as possible. No security stack is going to help. But thoughtful design can.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>However.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The tension for startups is that design for thoughtful design, and therefore for good security requires you to know what your product and service is doing, but in the early stages you may have to change the product quite a few times to get it right.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now you think I’m going to say that this is a difficult decision, blah blah blah, that startups should consider security early on, despite this.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not going to say that. I’m going to say that maybe a startup should <em>ignore</em> security, just a little bit.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I mean is: if I meet a startup who has spent ages on its security, pre getting some real customer traction, I am going to be nervous that they have over-engineered the product, and won’t be able to iterate. The product will be too brittle or too rigid to wiggle and iterate and achieve fit.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So it’s a balance.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Privacy:</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One of the reasons that security matters is because it can lead to privacy being violated. Or rather, let me clarify:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Poor security can mean a startup’s customer gives up privacy in an <em>unintended</em> way. That’s going to damage sales.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But what’s more of a preoccupation to me is when privacy is reduced in an <em>intended</em> way. You see this a lot when a startup has figured out how to make a business work by being not quite straight-up about what they’re doing with the data they’re collecting.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For example:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A consumer-facing startup that gets its product out for free, and then collects user data to sell later. I don’t believe consumers can ever really consent to data use in this fashion: it’s never really made clear. It pulls the startup’s interest and the consumer’s interest out of alignment, and that - in my view - makes it hard for the company to grow in a clear way. This contradiction at their heart will make it tough to make product decisions</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A B2B startup which operates by collecting data on behalf of its clients – for example, collecting images of faces of shoppers for retail analysis. This can be legally legitimate. But sometimes it can be legitimate but still wrong: if properly informed, a regular consumer would feel uncomfortable</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You would be surprised how many companies like these I encounter. Or maybe you wouldn’t be.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think it should be a point of greater social concern that consumers are asked to consent to data retention and usage when <em>even the people collecting the data</em> don’t know what it may be used for down the line. Object recognition and facial recognition is getting really good – but it wasn’t great or well known at the point I subscribed to most of the services I now trust with my data. Can it really be said I consented to this? So we need a better way to discuss this, in society.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With a more commercial hat on I subscribe to the view that, in most cases, <a href="https://www.richie.fi/blog/data-is-a-liability.html">big data is not an asset, it is a liability.</a> If it’s not necessary for the business model, then it’s an expense to keep it secure. So don’t keep incur that expense. For example, you don’t need to keep credit card numbers to take payments. OIutsource it. You don’t need to move video to the cloud to data to do image recognition – we have machine learning at the edge for that now.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But mainly, I think about this: is it <em>skeevy?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The tide has turned on privacy, just as it did for sustainability. For ages being sustainable was something companies did just to feel good about themselves. Now it’s both consumer expectation and good business.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With privacy? For B2B startups I feel that being privacy conscious is becoming a differentiator and should be advertised as such. No potential business customer will want to be associated with the risk of leaks, being hacked, or potential damage to the brand from revealed “skeevy” behaviour.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s not a negative thing. There’s opportunity here too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want to end with an example which is <a href="https://www.hoxtonanalytics.com">Hoxton Analytics</a>, a company I had the privilege of working with at the <a href="https://www.rgaiot.com">R/GA IoT accelerator</a> I ran earlier this year. By the way, we’re running another one, and applications close on <strong>7 December,</strong> just a few weeks from now. We can talk about that afterwards.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Hoxton Analytics supply, for their clients, pedestrian footfall intelligence. They count the number of people walking in and out of your shop.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Historically this has been done with infra-red beam interruption. Well, that can’t track groups or whether people are going in or out.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So instead you can do it by tracking smartphone signatures. Information-rich but not everyone has their Bluetooth or wi-fi turned on.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So you can really amp it up and monitor footfall with cameras doing facial recognition: that doesn’t fly in Europe, it’s personally identifiable information. Fine elsewhere in the world though. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Hoxton takes a different approach. They have cameras right down low on the floor, and they use machine learning - on the device - to recognise shoes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s crazy accurate. 95% accurate. It can also count group sizes, and whether people are going in or out. So it can do capacity.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It also doesn’t store personally identifiable information so it’s good in Europe.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But get this. Because they’ve built this solution, it means they can also use it in public places. So you can point the camera out of the window and see how many people are walking past, versus how many people are walking in. This is the holy grail, like a conversion funnel, like Google Analytics, but for physical retail. And they’ve got there by considering privacy not as a product constraint, but as a product <em>feature.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Wrap up:</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s where my head’s at regarding security and privacy. I’m going to chew on these thoughts a bunch before the discussion with Sarah, and I’d welcome your thoughts – either on my views as laid out above, or on questions to ask her.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t know if there are any tickets left but if there are <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/insecure-futures-privacy-security-and-connected-devices-tickets-38504445834">do come along</a> and if you’re already signed up, then I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday night.</p>
