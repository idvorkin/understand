  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been playing pandemic-breakout-hit board game <em>Wingspan</em> recently.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I kinda sorta wanna to see this gorgeous and hand-drawn ecology-fostering approach baked into financial modeling software, such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Your job in <em>Wingspan</em> to populate your wildlife refuge with birds (each a beautifully illustrated playing card). Birds cost food and an increasing number of eggs. You can gather food and lay eggs, the quantities of which are dependent on your population of birds.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://slate.com/culture/2021/08/wingspan-board-game-elizabeth-hargrave-review-profile.html" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Slate" data-title="How a Board Game About Birds Became a Surprise Blockbuster (2021)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Wingspan is what’s known among serious gamers as an “engine-building game,” which means that as the game goes on, the combination of birds you play becomes more and more efficient at generating points each turn, like an engine running faster and faster. Your cuckoo lays eggs, and the eggs not only give you points but make it possible to play more birds, which also give you more points but have their own powers that generate points in other ways.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Slate, <cite><a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/08/wingspan-board-game-elizabeth-hargrave-review-profile.html">How a Board Game About Birds Became a Surprise Blockbuster (2021)</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An <strong>engine builder.</strong> As opposed to “roll-and-move” and other mechanics.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And: <q>Activating the cascading effects of these healthy interconnections is the greatest pleasure of playing Wingspan.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The precise goals vary each game, for added fun, and there are a <em>ton</em> of birds, which all bring something different to the table. Like: bird such-and-such wins you 7 points and costs 3 of these particular foods and can fit 4 eggs in its nest and has a special power in that it encourages other birds to lay extra eggs too under whatever particular conditions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Getting this right is why the game works, and it was hard work: <q>It’s those interconnections that [Elizabeth] Hargrave began mapping out in a ginormous spreadsheet once she decided she really did want to design a board game.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(<a href="https://catsanddice.com/wingspan-strategy-tips-guide/">Here are some good Wingspan strategies.</a>)</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I don’t enjoy about <em>Wingspan</em> is that there are a ton of rules.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The cards and tokens (food, eggs) are merely indexes into the real game board, which exists only virtually, in rulespace.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Hargrave’s fearsome Excel spreadsheet is ever-present, hidden behind the curtain.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Compare with say Chess or Go. There are rules, sure, but they are relatively minimal. The state of the game is told more by the physicality of the pieces on the table.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Game theorists must have mathematics to describe this different. I would like to know!)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I would like to play another version of <em>Wingspan</em> in which the rules are somehow implicit in the physical geography of the pieces, instead of being written down on the cards and in the rulebook. I don’t know what that would look like.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You get a sense of acceleration in playing an engine builder!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s a great article from a game design perspective – how to harness the acceleration… but also how to slow it down: <a href="http://makethemplay.com/index.php/2019/06/10/engine-building/">Engine Building (2019)</a> on <em>Make Them Play: Learning About Board Game Design.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">e.g.:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The challenge is much more in balancing your engine. One major problem with an engine is that it can “run away”: If you can turn resources into <em>more</em> resources then whomever has a minor head start can quickly leave all other players behind without hopes of catching up. </p>
</blockquote>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s a very 21st century genre, right?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For example: building a startup is never about building the product. It’s about building a machine that knows how to ship product and how to sell it and how to use feedback to iterate it. And that knows how to grow itself as an organisation.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like, consider the Business Model Canvas (<a href="/home/2021/08/18/frameworks">as previously discussed</a>) – as a way of describing a startup on a single sheet of paper, it’s practically already a circuit diagram.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Also think about community development: how do you build a community which goes out and attract more community.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An engine that simply accelerates is entertaining to experience, but the joy is in the meta design – how do you create conditions such that player builds engines that <em>don’t</em> blow up?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How do you create a startup or a community which grows in depth and complexifies, but doesn’t churn out or ossify? Wiring up the feedback loops, balancing the world. How do you make an ecology which expands when appropriate and renews yet remains heterogeneous and manageable?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And ecosystems truly are a 21st century preoccupation. With the climate crisis and its runaway feedback loops, and pandemics with their exponentials, and social media with its virality, this isn’t like the old days of the industrial revolution where the plumbing was steam and electricity – relatively manageable stock and flow. No, we’re trying to manage circuits and networks of lashed-together exponentials; unstable equilibria all round, if you get it wrong then systems explode or die before you blink. Tread either carefully or really, really fast.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Hobbies in this <em>Wingspan</em> world are things like bonsai and terrariums – games of <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/haynes.htm">ecopoiesis</a>: <q>a new word which means ‘the making of an abode for life’,</q> said biologist Robert Haynes in 1993.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I wondered before about <a href="/home/2021/03/26/poker">giving out bonsai trees at business school</a> to see what mindset they impart – and I’m wondering more directly now: what is Microsoft Office but designed on terrarium principles? What would it be like to work in <em>Excel: Wingspan Edition?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been looking at liquid computing recently, specifically the MONIAC (Monetary National Income Analogue Computer) a.k.a. the Phillips Hydraulic Computer a.k.a. the Financephalograph, invented by Bill Phillips in 1949. They’ve got one in the London Science Museum:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The MONIAC is a model of the British economy built as a two-meter tall machine with a water tank at the top and equations modeled <q>using pipes, valves, tanks and pumps.</q></p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/how-does-economy-work" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Science Museum" data-title="How Does the Economy Work?">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Bill Phillips used water to represent money as it flowed around the economic system. Valves could be opened or closed to represent variable effects, such as the rate of interest on savings or investment.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Graphical curves, describing things such as the way interest rates varied over time, could be cut into plastic sheets and physically ‘read’ by the machine as it operated.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Science Museum, <cite><a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/how-does-economy-work">How Does the Economy Work?</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(There’s a great video at that link too.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As a liquid computer, it was an empirical way to solve the equations to arrive at something balanced, i.e. where you don’t end up with an empty or overflowing treasury tank.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And so: <q>When a set of parameters resulted in a viable economy the model would stabilise and the results could be read from scales.</q> <em>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONIAC">From Wikipedia.</a>)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">ALL OF WHICH MAKES ME ASK:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Isn’t the lesson of MONIAC that it is interesting to build financial models that are seeking balance (or at least, are evolving slowly enough that they can be managed) not necessarily ones that are trying to go perpetually up and to the right?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What would it means to have a version of Excel that was always iterating in the background, always running the engine, giving you a readout of whether your model would blow up over time, or whether you were tuning it towards balance?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, imagining this: every sheet would automatically come with an infinite stack of sheets of how it evolves over time. Every non-formula cell would default go to zero unless you declared an external conduit, a value which would be added or subtracted per tick of the clock. Constant numbers would be banned: everything has to come from somewhere.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A special function would colour-code a cell according to whether it diverged to infinity, converged to zero, or remained stable over time.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You get to write only onto the <code class="f7 black-80">t=0</code> initial conditions top sheet.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Elizabeth Hargrave repurposed Excel to design an engine-builder that doesn’t lead to runaway inequality between players and doesn’t rapaciously consume the game board, yet leads to collaboration and complexity over time. What if we built the ideal version of Excel for <em>her,</em> and gave <em>that</em> to MBAs to build their companies?</p>
