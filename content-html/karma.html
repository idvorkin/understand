  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s interesting to look at karma with this lens: an explanatory framework for <em>progress.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I was listening to this recent <em>In Our Time</em> episode about…</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.braggoscope.com/2024/06/23/karma.html" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="In Our Time (Braggoscope)" data-title="Karma">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the doctrine of Karma as developed initially among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists in India from the first millennium BCE. Common to each is an idea, broadly, that you reap what you sow: <u>how you act in this world has consequences either for your later life or your future lives</u>, depending on your view of rebirth and transmigration.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– In Our Time (Braggoscope), <cite><a href="https://www.braggoscope.com/2024/06/23/karma.html">Karma</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the idea of reincarnation is widespread - “karma” is first mentioned in 1500 BCE, the Ancient Greeks have “metempsychosis” - but around 800 BCE the idea of karma develops in India in this direction:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the specifics of this moral mechanism</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You can be re-born as a plant, animal, human (in one joke “even as a cooking pot”) – depending on how you behave.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s to do with your <em>actions.</em> It’s a physics of ethics.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In India it’s more systematic. It’s seen as an automatic mechanism, almost like a science, a physics of reality, and it has this moral characteristic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But I hadn’t really thought about what re-birth <em>means.</em> This transmigration.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like, is there a continuation of identity? Nooooo… it’s fuzzier than that. There are metaphors…</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the self is like a caterpillar that crawls up a blade of grass and reaches over to another blade, and crawls down it to the ground again. The soul is a creature that can travel through this life, reach to another life, and come back to a new life again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which gives me a glimpse.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Though what is the exact nature of this? It’s hugely debated…</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like is it just a connection: <q>when you’re teaching a student, what is passed on?</q> - <q>there’s nothing physical</q> - <q>it’s a causal relation</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or is there an ongoing self: <q>The soul changing its clothes</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(It feels like the opposite of the <em>Star Trek</em> transporter: in the transporter you are broken into data about atoms, faxed down to the planet’s surface, and reconstructed – and let’s be clear here, it’s not you, right? You’re dead, it’s someone who looks like you, with your memories, and they believe they’re you, but it’s not you, <em>Star Trek</em> proposes a material universe with the transporter but then logically is full of dead people who die over and over again, and deny it. Contrariwise karma says that you die but something <em>persists.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Whichever it is, karma includes this longitudinal focus on <em>life after life</em> which I will say as a claim is weaker than immortality, and stronger than ancestors/descendants.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ultimately, I was utterly taken with this statement from the episode:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the morality of this means that <u>we have the possibility of progress</u>. It’s not one life and you’re done, it’s like being a goldsmith. As a goldsmith crafts a beautiful statue, and if he doesn’t like it, can melt it back down again, and try to make something more perfect, so that’s what our lives are. They’re attempts, and they can get better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The possibility of progress!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ah-ha!</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I know this quote is about individual progress, let’s call it progress-1. But some branches of karma get into cohort transmigration, and that takes us closer to the sense in which I’m taking it, progress-2, today’s conception of progress: something singular that pervades all, a new nature, borderline Whig history or manifest destiny in a way, that we all contribute to but has its own identity and history and direction. The two senses overlap in some mysterious fashion.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now this is where that thought took me, the idea that karma allows for the possibility of progress, ambiguously progress-1 and progress-2:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I always wonder about the function of systems.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well not <em>the</em> function, systems are multivariate, but <em>a</em> function certainly.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then I think about systems and frameworks we have today with overlapping roles. That helps me see the ancient way, not monumentalising it, and that gives me new perspectives on today. Look, it’s a method.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And karma, yes it’s a moral framework <em>now,</em> but what’s the mega trend of 1500 BCE, what created the conditions such that it emerged in the first place, what was it there to <em>do?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Was that when progress first became noticeable?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is where my imagination takes me, let’s be clear, I’m speculating.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But listen… there’s always been the idea of change, right, and even history (which, in the west, only emerged as a concept a little later, in Classical Greece) is just one thing after another.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I mean there <em>was</em> progress - stone to bronze to iron - but I get the impression that it wasn’t obvious.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now suddenly you have kingdoms and cities, I mean Ur was 3800 BCE, but you have a flourishing in India in this period, so there’s a density of population, an urban way of life, and clearly this is part of the exponential acceleration of human civilisation and technology that we are still part of, and:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe this is when the progress exponential became rapid enough, became noticeable for the first time? Maybe that’s the context we’re talking about.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like: <em>how do you explain progress?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s what you’d be asking, when progress itself was new.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Meanwhile the Mycenaean Greeks in the ancient world were developing a cosmology of descent, from the gods, to the age of heroes, to today (and tomorrow, which will be worse). Still we see the arrow of time.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ll come back to karma in a sec.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Progress Studies</em> was invented as a discipline in 2019:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen, The Atlantic" data-title="We Need a New Science of Progress (2019)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Progress itself is understudied. By “progress,” we mean the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries. For a number of reasons, there is no broad-based intellectual movement focused on understanding the dynamics of progress, or targeting the deeper goal of speeding it up. We believe that it deserves a dedicated field of study. We suggest inaugurating the discipline of “Progress Studies.”</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen, The Atlantic, <cite><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">We Need a New Science of Progress (2019)</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The authors agree that “progress” is a loaded term: <q>We know that, to some readers, the word progress may sound too normative.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Normative in its “what ought to be” sense, i.e. perhaps fairness, as in normative economics, not in its sense meaning “standard”.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And to me, that overloading of “progress” is really the point: this is not just a study of how and why change happens, but also why it tends in a particular direction (“progress”), and <em>also</em> the new discipline includes this huge moral SHOULD - that is, <q>normative</q> - because it’s not just a study of “history seems to have directionality and it can go slower or faster” but it is called PROGRESS.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So it’s an opinionated discipline, and they make that axiomatic: <q>we must affirmatively make the case for the study of how to improve human well-being.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I see <em>progress studies</em> as a positive activity: let’s not just work on being better, but work on being better at being better.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well, but how?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So progress studies rhymes with karma, for me.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Both are concerned in explaining why the world improves.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Again, I am not speaking about karma itself here, but the associations it sets up in my head.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Imagine spotting progress for the very first time! So karma, to me, also brings in the mechanism:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">if you look at nature, even though you can’t see the seed below the ground, it gives rise to plants again and again, and that gives us a clue as to how humans work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Quote from the <em>In Our Time</em> episode.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Some new entity</em> is being proposed, something that we can neither see nor touch but has a reality that strongly affects our own. Like gravity, as an analogy, but not just a force, which is a symptom, the Higgs field itself maybe.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What is it?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What is this fabric of souls, how do we think of it?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I see it as something between “culture,” which is the sum of our values and norms and material artefacts, and Kevin Kelly’s concept of the <a href="https://commonreader.wustl.edu/the-technium-and-how-kevin-kelly-changed-his-mind/">technium</a> – <q>our system of tools and machines</q> that has <q>biases and tendencies … agency</q>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think of that idea (that karmically haha comes round and comes round again): <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/26/shape/">We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Society is not something that we’re in, it’s something that we do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0YdK_Tds4Y">As I said million years ago</a> <em>(100 Hours, TedXAthens, YouTube).</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The picture for me is this:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Re-birth in karma is the interplay between the individual and the abstracted culture (of ideas, tools, etc) that we create which has - it turns out, this is the best way to conceive of it - its own existence, and looking at it in this way, we create culture, and also we precipitate out of culture.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Culture or whatever, really. The land at the top of the blades of grass.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We live on through our acts!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So it helps make sense of all of that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then karma differs from progress studies, aside from scale of course, in these two ways:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">first by proposing the <em>mechanism</em> of progress, being re-birth according to some arithmetic,</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">and secondly by asking, well, if we have this progress concept, we’re not just observers here, what direction do we want, what <em>should</em> we want?</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now suddenly we have this rich terrain of moral argument and learning.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For me, this is now where I want to pay closer attention, to take lessons from karma - a vast and ancient and filigreed tradition - its morality in particular, the debates on intention and trade-offs, in order to think about the politics of progress.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">FOOTNOTE.</p>
