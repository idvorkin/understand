  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s an idea from the 1950s about physical rooms and index cards for shared context and collaboration.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And thinking about how to make a modern version gets me thinking about room-scale group use computers, and what kind of interfaces we’ll need.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">No conclusions today, but thinking out loud…</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The map room is a physical multiplayer learning machine</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Consider a room!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s 1954 (or 1955) and a group of disciplines are working together on a complicated decade-long regional development plan for the Hacienda Vicos community in Peru. Represented: anthropology, economics, political science, and psychology.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How do they find a common vocabulary? How do they share data and ideas? How do they plan action?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Enter the <strong>map room.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">whose walls contained a large matrix with the time (in years) on the ordinate and with the “variables” the group was interested in along the abscissa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s the paper: <strong><a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Kennedy%20-%20Administration%20of%20Research%20in%20a%20Research%20Corporation.html">Administration of Research in a Research Corporation</a></strong> by Kennedy &amp; Putt, RAND Corporation Report No. P-847, April 20, 1956.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(It’s an important paper, and I’ll say why later.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Variables, and index cards:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">130 variables, grouped under “government,” “economics,” “social relations,” “education and mass media,” “health and welfare,” and “attitudes.” There were spaces for three-by-five cards for each of ten years under each variable. The entire matrix thus could hold 1,300 cards that summarized the value of the variable in the past or described its desired value for the future. At the top of each column was a description of the value of the variable “in the best of all possible worlds” and a statement of the value anticipated or desired at the end of the ten-year experimental period (1951-1961).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Data and planning:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The contextual map records past decisions and actions as well as predictions and anticipated reactions for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The room is architected for discussions and decisions, not just visits:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The map room contained a conference table and chairs so that decision-making and planning conferences could be held there. Thus the group was continually confronted with the developing map and the members were constantly aware of gaps in the information and suggested priorities for items to be considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Thus:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The map was a large, living memory for the group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Other observations about the map room:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Briefing is simply a matter of <q>taking new people into the map room for a briefing and allowing them to wander</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>The map room is, in one sense, a “learning machine”</q> – comprising two parts. The planners: <q>thinking and adapting</q> And the display: <q>making the complete context of the decisions readily available.</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The physical room should be reconfigurable. Ideally, <q>many decision-making groups should be able to use a number of maps simultaneously in the same general area.</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s a compelling concept for collaborative, open-ended work!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That was 1955. What could we do in the 2020s, with hybrid environments, networked computers, and embodied interaction?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">I’ve glossed over the origin of the map room because it was, uh, not great</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">First, a digression.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the project for which the map room was created was the “development” of Hacienda Vicos, a 2,500 person, 22,000 acre community on the slopes of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s described as a <q>complex interacting cultural system</q> – long-standing custom involved households dedicating some portion of time and labour to the community, with them subsisting on land held in common. I don’t doubt that life would be hard, but none-the-less it sounds like rich and meaningful mutualism.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yet, the paper says without further discussion, it is “recognised” that the hacienda is an “anachronism” and has to go in the face of modern technology like hydroelectrics, trucks, schools, and communications.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Worse, it looks like the map room itself was physically located not in Peru but in <s>Stanford</s> Cornell, and the copies of the contextual map were made to be used? imposed? in the field in the hacienda itself.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s horrific colonialism.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The opportunity to <em>ask</em> the hacienda community how and <em>if</em> it wanted to change was right there. New technology could have been added to the community matrix – or not!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The map room would have been the perfect forum for the decisions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I’m pleased to discover, on some light googling, that the Hacienda Vicos “project” is regarded as “controversial.”</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With that giant looming caveat, back to map rooms.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The map room paper was Engelbart’s first citation</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The map room holds a contextual map: the matrix of index cards.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The contextual map is put forward as a technique for a multidisciplinary group to find a <em>conceptual framework.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What is a conceptual framework and why does it matter?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s look at one: <strong><a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138">Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</a></strong> by Douglas Engelbart, 1962.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is the paper that unlocked ARPA funding when JCR Licklider read it, and set out the research programme that led to the invention and demo of the personal computer, the mouse etc in 1968 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To my mind, the 1962 paper hinges on two meta-principles.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The first is that Engelbart adopts the framing of a conceptual framework at all.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Kennedy &amp; Putt, for the RAND Corporation in 1956, set out to summarise how to build an effective research organisation.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">They identify that different disciplines will tend to follow their own groove: <q>Research specialists, like all other living organisms, will go to great lengths to maintain a comfortable position.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And therefore answers will remain “unintegrated.” True cooperation will not occur.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The requirement, they say, is for a framework</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">that within which <q>research administrators and research specialists may interact and make decisions about what research should be performed</q>, and</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">provides for <q>effective communication with persons engaged in development</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Something that can cut across disciplines; that all feel like they are contributing to.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Engelbart reads this paper! It unlocks something for him.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">From Engelbart’s own oral history of his work (which is worth read in its entirety)…</p>
<blockquote cite="https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Engelbart/Engelbart_AugmentWorkshop.html" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Doug Engelbart" data-title="The Augmented Knowledge Workshop">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then I discovered a great little RAND report written by Kennedy and Putt that described my situation marvellously and recommended a solution. Their thesis was that when launching a project of [a new discipline] the researcher would encounter consistent problems in approaching people in established disciplines. They wouldn’t perceive your formulations and goals as relevant, and they would become disputative on the apparent basis that your positions were contrary to ‘’accepted” knowledge or methods. The trouble, said these authors, was that each established discipline has its own ‘’conceptual framework.” The enculturation of young professionals with their discipline’s framework begins in their first year of professional school. Without such a framework, tailored for the goals, values, and general environment of the respective discipline, there could be no effective, collaborative work. Furthermore, if such a conceptual framework did not already exist for a new type of research, then before effective research should be attempted, an appropriate, unique framework needs to be created. They called this framework creation process the ‘’Search Phase.’‘</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><u>So, I realized that I had to develop an appropriate conceptual framework for the augmentation pursuit that I was hooked on.</u> That search phase was not only very sweaty, but very lonely.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The result is his 1962 paper. Kennedy &amp; Putt is number 1 in the references.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What was Engelbart’s eventual framework?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well it’s fully about augmented human intellect, and read his paper for that, but here is the second of the two meta-principles: he followed JCR Licklider in atomising knowledge-worker activity. (Yes, Licklider who went on to fund Engelbart. What else could he do?)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/home/2022/11/04/somaforming">I talked about this before:</a> Licklider had analysed his own thinking process, and discovered that 85% of the work was searching, calculating, plotting, transforming, and so on… bureaucratically “preparing the way”.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As Engelbart put it: <q>Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes</q> – and that bureaucratic work is tractable to computed-aided support.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Licklider published his work in <em>Man-Computer Symbiosis</em> (1960) and that’s Engelbart’s reference #15 – to my mind, it is this approach that uniquely leads to the functionality in the demo and eventually “tools for thought” generally, and is the heart of the <em>“augmenting”</em> conceptual framework, unlocking the required multidisciplinary work of engineers and psychologists.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Engelbart’s <em>“very sweaty, very lonely”</em> slog to his framework is what the map room concept was intended to short-circuit – why make that journey alone when you can do it together?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>And that’s why I’d like to find ways to reinvent the map room today,</strong> because we <em>do</em> need new multidisciplinary conceptual frameworks, and it would be cool to have new tools to help us to get there.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let me rattle through a few other immersive information rooms so we have some references!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>SAGE</strong> (1958)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/home/2021/12/21/sage">Here’s my history of SAGE</a>: the massive computing project (3x the size of the Manhattan Project) that preceded the PC, brought in the interactive computer, and gave us a glimpse of group computing which is so far unrealised.</p>

<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Each of the men (yes all men) has their own computer console at their desk. But they’re working together around the PDU. One of the men is holding what is either a light gun or a laser pointer/equivalent. They’re assessing potential threats and ordering missiles and bombers. Together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This isn’t a setup for presentations and discussions. It’s for collaboration and action. The whole room is an environment for the team to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Group use. Shared context.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And from there we can go Nasa’s flight control centers, or NORAD in the movie <em>WarGames</em> – but I’m more interested in the individual/small group rooms.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Same belief in human collaboration, same belief in context. Same mid-20th century, uh, awkward politics.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">btw the architectural aesthetic: <q>The room was designed by Gui Bonsiepe, an innovative German designer who studied and taught at the famed Ulm School of Design, in Germany, and industrial design associated with the Ulm School inspired Steve Jobs and the Apple designer Jonathan Ive.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>But before any of these, even before the original map room…</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…there was the Prime Radiant of Isaac Asimov’s <em>Second Foundation.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Published as a novel in 1952, and based on the novellas in <em>Astounding</em> magazine in 1948-1950, this was Asimov’s science-fictional user interface for Seldon’s Plan, the map of the present and the future of the galaxy according to the science of psychohistory.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">[the Plan] is projected on the wall as a network of dense, interlocking equations by a device named the “Prime Radiant,” and manipulated using a combination of gestural interface and thought control. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/home/2012/03/13/user_interface_of_seldons_plan">I pulled out relevant passages here.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Prime Radiant isn’t just a device – <q>Consider a room!</q> Asimov begins. It’s a forum for the “guardians” of the Plan to discuss together and make decisions together. Shared context and interactivity! Collaboration!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I wonder how much influence in the imagination this “technology” had? Did RAND researchers read <em>Astounding?</em></p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Ephemeral vs accretive tools and why there’s still room for map rooms</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can’t remember if I’ve shared this before but my mental model of modern collaboration tools is that they fall into two camps.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Ephemeral</strong> tools are about the conversation. Slack is one. Zoom is another. Google Docs, weirdly, is another, even though it’s all about files. There’s no shared “front page” to Google Drive and no Schelling Points for team members to gather around, so all documents are temporary working documents (and doing otherwise is pushing water uphill).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Accretive</strong> tools build over time. Developer tools tend to work like this: platform-as-code. Wikis are the main one: <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> is accretive. (I love Notion.) Pipeline-based tools like Trello fall on the accretive end, for me – memory resides in the tool, not the users. Accretive tools need gardening because they don’t forget by default.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not sure these are the right terms. Maybe: <a href="https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/">stock and flow</a>?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe: <em>oral and literate?</em> I also feel like you get two cultures of organisations. Oral orgs believe that knowledge resides in individuals, and they are forever emailing each other and having meetings and making custom decks. It allows for expertise. Literate orgs treat people as interchangeable parts and scurry over shared edifices – but they build cathedrals.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Map rooms, in my terminology, are an accretive tool.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">They are shared <q>living memory</q> – external from individual skulls.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which is what, say, Notion does.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the map room also provides the <em>overview.</em> (As does the Prime Radiant!)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I was playing with this idea recently, in a tiny way, when I was <a href="/home/2022/11/09/map">mapping my posts about the multiplayer web</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">My learnings were that (a) maps should be authored not generated automatically; and (b) the map is a separate and just as valuable artefact as the territory that it maps.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, imagine something like Notion, but</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">it has authored maps for overviews – <em>vast</em> overviews</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">you build and interact with maps together with your team, with shared and individual views side-by-siude</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">with fluid movement between the macro and the molecular.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s not just “whiteboard” view, for me. There’s more.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Could you build a map room today? Maybe embodiment matters</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes I know agencies have “war rooms” with post-its for project management and concepts for #brands all over the walls. But that’s a technique out of the 1950s it turns out – I mean, could we bring the technology of map rooms into the 2020s?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Something software-enabled, something multiplayer, something that embraces <em>“hybrid”</em> so we don’t have to be either all in one geographic location or all at home.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think embodiment matters here?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It matters, in the map room, where you’re standing. It matters, in the map room and in the palace of memory simultaneously, that you can focus on some details and discard others because they’re in peripheral vision or behind you, or remember where you spotted something. It matters, in the map room, who you’re near. It matters if you see somebody lingering near an index card that you happen to know something about, and you can walk over and talk to them about it. All of that!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>So in my imagination Map Room 2.0 looks something like this…</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Consider a room with a projector that shows an overview of your whole “map”. Maybe, just like the original map room, it’s a matrix of variables and time.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We all have that projector: me in my home office, and you in yours, and the others in the office meeting room. We navigate the map with gestures. It shows the same view for everyone. We don’t all need the identical physical setup – the projector can be large or small or point at any wall.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For looking closer, we use our phones and tablets. Those are individual.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But there’s some kind of equivalent to embodiment (and presence and proxemics): the system has gaze detection… it knows where you’re looking. And it also knows what index card you’re examining on your personal device.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Gaze and individual browsing are shown as icons on the shared map, like seeing coloured cursors in a Google Doc. Maybe the icon, or cursor, gets bigger if the viewer is standing closer to their projection.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">More hardware peripherals: everyone wears earbuds + mic. There’s proximity audio so, if you’re in the main shared space, you can hear remote people who have their cursors near where you’re looking. There’s a “shout” button that speaks to the whole room.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So it’s wiki-like software, with multiplayer cursors and a virtual spatial metaphor, plus overview maps, and there’s hardware to make a hybrid tele-environment for everyone participating.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Something like that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A new map room.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">A new conceptual framework for new conceptual frameworks</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s useful talking through the above because it’s hard for me to do so – it feels difficult to reason about a new map room because I can’t (yet) imagine what a physical computing environment should <em>be.</em> Not with much resolution.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What are the primitives, like the equivalents to the windows, icons, menus, and pointers? How would people use it together? How would the various input/output modes braid together? What’s the conceptual framework for <em>that?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And this is <a href="/home/2021/12/21/sage">a topic I’ve circled before</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">WHAT IF, instead of the Personal Computer, the dividend of SAGE had been the Team Computer?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A computer that wasn’t used individually but as a group, together in a room or perhaps remotely. Not desktops but environments. An alternate history of computing that doesn’t involve user IDs or ownership as primary concepts but is instead oriented around collaborative, co-created artefacts, spaces that are jointly inhabited. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As useful as a 20XXs map room would be, it feels like first I need to spend some time exploring computing environments in general.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Another time.</p>
