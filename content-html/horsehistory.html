  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This starts speculative and ends up in an interesting place: an algorithm for improving language. (My personal algorithm for new ideas appears to include: think about nonsense for longer than most others are prepared to tolerate.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">These words all start with <em>horse-:</em></p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horsefly – a fly found near horses, fair enough</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horseplay – totally understandable, but a metaphor that only makes sense if you have been friends with horses</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horsepower – sadly not like “sea power”</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horseradish – a root and a condiment</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horsetrade – now a useful way to talk about an equitable negotiation that involved a lot of back-and-forth, originally I’m sure to do with horses</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Note that these are unlike: horsehair, horserider, horseshoe, etc, which are direct attributes of a horse. That is you could equally say “horse’s hair” and so on.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So it’s fun to invent other <em>horse-</em> words and speculate what they might mean. Some at random:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horsefunctor</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horsehistory</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horseorbital</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horseroman</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Horsesane</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>For example, #1:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/robmil/status/1404859723422306305?s=21">Rob Miller suggested on Twitter:</a> <q>Black Beauty is my favourite horseroman.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And that’s neat, right? “Roman” as in <em>roman à clef,</em> a novel not-so-secretly based on real life events, and <em>Black Beauty</em> is a novel about a horse. BUT ALSO maybe a <em>horseroman</em> could be like the famously equine senator appointed by Nero in Ancient Rome.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s blend those two and throw in some semantic drift, then define <em>horseroman</em> as one of those thought leaders who is appointed by the people in charge, but is actually way out of their comfort zone, and answers all questions with lengthy anecdotes about their own life. Like a bad TED talk.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>For example, #2:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/petebleackley/status/1404868151305723907?s=21">Peter Bleakley pointed out that</a>: <q>The “horse” in “horseradish” is nothing to do with horses. It’s cognate with “coarse” and indicates “inedible”. Same as “horse chestnut”.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So let’s take that and apply it!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe <em>horsehistory</em> could be the socially uncomfortable parts of our history that we brush under the carpet? A useful new term!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Thank you Tom Carden for <a href="https://twitter.com/RandomEtc/status/1404861728228323328?s=20">continuing this conversation on Twitter</a> yesterday.)</em></p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The first analysis from a horsehistorical perspective</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This section is a tangent but I want to show you that the concept is useful.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I was never really taught about the British Empire or colonisation at school. Sure I knew about it, but it was always in the background, taken for granted. Sure there were some ugly aspects but aren’t there always.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then in my 30s I visited a museum in Kolkata and unexpectedly began to learn about the atrocities committed by my country, and the feeling of sickness and shame that started on that day has never left me. I have continued to educate myself. What’s worse is that I <em>did</em> know some of the events, but I hadn’t stopped to consider them.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Empire is not, in the UK, <em>ignored</em> history. We all know it. But when you grow up with something from before you can speak, and leave it unanalysed, you accept facts that you would never accept as an adult. I imagine it’s a little like abuse: if you grow up in an abusive household, it takes <em>work</em> as an adult to realise: <em>that wasn’t normal! That was not ok!</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now some of this is unconscious, but some of it is very much deliberate. We have leaders who <em>do</em> know history, who <em>are</em> able to talk about Empire (what it was, what we did, what we are still doing), but keep silent and make use of the <em>idea</em> of Empire (“Global Britain”, now). And because there’s utility in maintaining this myth in its unanalysed state, a kind of systemic resistance arises: anybody who <em>does</em> attempt to talk about Empire in an adult, clear-eyed way is aggressively shouted down. See the current culture war about “decolonising the curriculum” in universities which, to my mind, is simply about saying: let’s not take this history for granted.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">My pet theory:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You can’t really talk about society as an individual, but give me this rope for a second. “British society” is aware of Empire and its atrocities, but conscious acceptance of that knowledge is repressed – for whatever reason: because it runs counter to our identity, because it is inconvenient, because then we would have to do something about it, because it was awful, take your pick.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In short, the history of the British Empire is impossible for British society to digest.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In an individual, repressed feelings find <em>other</em> ways to come out. So the repressed idea of colonisation came out as Brexit, which was this almost fanatical belief that <em>we</em> were being colonised by a larger state, EU. Or, to be blunt: that the pains that the British Empire had inflicted on others were now being inflicted on us.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I read this as a way to psychologically square the circle of the repression: to say, it’s ok to avoid looking at the history of Empire squarely in the face, because look it’s fair now, we’ve been punished.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway, that’s my amateur read.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s also the first application of <em>horsehistory:</em> the study of undigestable histories and what they do to us. Agree or disagree with my analysis in this instance, the area opened up is interesting.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe this study could also look at the ways that horsehistories become regular histories, and how we could take British society through that journey (several other countries with atrocities in their past have been able to look at their history with clear eyes, act accordingly, and are healthier for it).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or we might also examine how horsehistories ossify over time (or not), or catalogue them globally, or re-analyse existing histories.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A new word becomes a new lens for understanding the world.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Words as coordinates in the space of all possible concepts</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back to the <em>horse-</em> prefix. What does it do to words?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s not a straight modifier. Horseplay is not the play of a horse (not any longer), nor horseradish a horse’s radish. It’s an unexpectedly transformative operator, in a way that I don’t yet understand.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe: it’s a matrix rotation in embedding space?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To unpack that:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An “embedding” is how machine learning encodes concepts.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A good example is <em>word2vec,</em> an old technique (old meaning 2013) that takes words and translates them into coordinates in a multi-dimensional space of all possible concepts. The set of coordinates is called the embedding.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What’s neat is that the embeddings can be mathematically combined. That is to say:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>king - man + woman = queen</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If you take the coordinates for <em>king,</em> subtract <em>man</em> and add <em>woman,</em> you get the coordinates for <em>queen.</em> Approximately…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>The resulting vector from “king-man+woman” doesn’t exactly equal “queen”, but “queen” is the closest word to it from the 400,000 word embeddings we have in this collection.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That example is from the EXCELLENT guide from Jay Allamar, <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">The Illustrated Word2vec</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So thinking about the concept <em>horsehistory</em> using this model and attempting to decompose it, what we see is that it’s <em>not</em> the mathematical addition of the <em>horse</em> embedding and the <em>history</em> embedding. The <em>horse-</em> prefix has mutated the <em>history</em> embedding somehow and turned it into something else. That mutation is what I’m referring to as a matrix rotation.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let me try another way:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Have you every tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synsepalum_dulcificum">miracle fruit</a>? It’s a berry with unusual property – it doesn’t have a taste itself, but it changes <em>other</em> tastes. In particular it rotates sour to sweet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I had some of these berries and was drinking beer, and the beer tasted like Fanta. Amazing! Then some time later, suddenly as I was crossing a road, the berries wore off and I tasted the inside of my mouth as if for the first time, and good grief it was disgusting.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The <em>horse-</em> prefix is the miracle berry of words.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And also:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">New words are addresses to previously unused embeddings in concept space.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The invention of new words provides new scaffolding for thought</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think what I’m convinced by, with <em>horsehistory,</em> is that it’s worth developing new words.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In the sci-fi novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Tongue_(Elgin_novel)">Native Tongue</a> <em>(<a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/native-tongue/9781473227569">Bookshop.org</a>)</em> about aliens, linguistics, and a fierce patriarchy, Suzette Haden Elgin supposes a new language for women. The creation of this artificial language is an act of resistance and also way to carve out a space for unique feminist thought and being. (It’s a stunning book.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In <em>Native Tongue,</em> discovering a new word in this new language is a big deal: a new word, a new concept, a new “Encoding” as Elgin calls it, a new valid embedding in concept phase space, we might say. Finding a new Encoding rarely happens! Each Encoding is hard won. If somebody discovers/invents one or two, that is huge news!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And so it is for us, I think. Discovering a new concept that isn’t simply a metaphorical framing, today, is rare and propels thought. Back to “Brexit” for a second: it derived from “Grexit,” itself a neologism (for Greece leaving the EU), but <em>having been coined</em>  it was possible to poke at it the concept, to discuss it, to ask about how it could happen and if so when and what it would mean, and so on, and without the word I believe the process would have unfolded in another way entirely.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes we can initially refer to these same concepts in other more cumbersome ways, but as single words it is possible to combine and manipulate more ideas that are more complex, and then they take on their own reality. Cheap referents have value.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Metaphorically, I’ve long believed that this process is what the Old Testament story of Moses receiving the Commandments is about, at least partially. There is an arduous journey - up a mountain - at which point some simple rules that are received, literally inscribed into rock. The rules are straightforward and lead to a long-term healthy and stable society, at least in this belief framework, but are hard to arrive at from first principles. The foundational ideas are too unwieldy and require a rare perspective. Similarly, great minds dedicate their lives to climbing their own mountains to claim complex insights similarly inscribed in simple terms and, having received the new concept in a graspable formulation and bringing it down the mountain for us, our whole society benefits.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The question is: is it possible to move beyond <em>Native Tongue?</em> It’s slow. Can we automate the process of concept discovery?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">A reward function for the invention of new words</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes there are ways to invent new words with AI. Take the website <a href="https://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com">ThisWordDoesNotExist.com</a> which generates a random word and a plausible definition (making use of GPT-2, the ancestor of GPT-3 which, as previously discussed <a href="/home/2020/09/04/idea_machine">is an idea machine</a>). For example here’s one generated word:</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The problem is that <em>tokou</em> isn’t as useful as, say, <em>horsehistory</em> (at least on first glance). We could sit there, refreshing the website, trying out each word to see if it’s handy, but that’s a bottleneck in the process and besides I would lack the domain expertise in most cases. So any algorithm will have automate that process too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s the algorithm I propose.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>1. Invent candidate words and their definitions.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Either invent at random, or use the method I ran by hand above: collide multiple embeddings and jiggle the result with semantic drift. That was how the <em>horseroman</em> concept was generated. An AI can do this.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now we effectively have two languages: English, which is the language we speak, and <em>English-Prime,</em> which is identical save for the addition of this single new word.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>2. Translate all of human knowledge into English-Prime.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This isn’t as hard as is sounds.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Google Translate has used, since November 2016, a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Neural_Machine_Translation">Google Neural Machine Translation</a>. It’s a machine learning method of translation between language pairs.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But look closer at how it works…</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-ai-language-create" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Wired" data-title="Google's AI just created its own universal 'language' (2016)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“Visual interpretation of the results shows that these models learn a form of interlingua representation for the multilingual model between all involved language pairs,” the researchers wrote in the paper.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An interlingua is a type of artificial language, which is used to fulfil a purpose. In this case, the interlingua was used within the AI to explain how unseen material could be translated.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">… The data within the network allowed the team to interpret that the neural network was “encoding something” about the semantics of a sentence rather than comparing phrase-to-phrase translations.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In short, Google Translate has an intermediary language that exists only in the form of embeddings.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, even without training data already written our new English-Prime, we know how to represent it in language space: it’s identical to English but with a single extra embedding available. And if we know that, Google Translate can translate into it. (Exactly how is left as an exercise for the reader.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which means that step 2 is to automatically translate all of Wikipedia into English-Prime.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>3. The reward function: test whether the new word is useful</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What does useful mean? Machine learning has the idea of a “reward function”: how do we state what good looks like? If we can do that, the process can run automatically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For <em>horsehistory</em> it meant that the word acted as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_pump">intuition pump</a> (philosopher Daniel Dennett’s term): by examining what it <em>could</em> mean, it took me to a place where complex ideas were reached and could then be articulated more efficiently.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what is our reward function? Simply:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Compare the word count of Wikipedia in English and the word count of Wikipedia in English-Prime. If the latter is shorter, i.e. more efficient, then the proposed new word is useful.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">RINSE AND REPEAT.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Each new term is a new place to start thinking. Give each its own journal and academic conference and see what happens.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Let me summarise.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">By way of speculating about a single new field of study, <em>horsehistory,</em> I have proposed <strong>a general method for the automatic generation of many new fields of study.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In the same way that Magnus Carlsen is a “centaur” chess player, a player of chess greater than any other human because he has trained with a custom AI and benefited from the wisdom of this machine which is <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/superhistory-not-superintelligence">effectively 200 data-years old</a>, the method I propose leads to a new discipline of <em>centaur philosophers,</em> thinkers who are able to systemically reveal new scaffoldings for thought, far beyond what would ordinarily be reached in a single human lifetime, to more rapidly develop and examine new ideas for the betterment of society at large.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or the whole thing is horsefeathers. Take your pick.</p>
