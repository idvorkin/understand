  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Apple launched <em>“Apple Intelligence”</em> yesterday – their take on AI.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I want to zoom in on the new Siri but first here’s my mental model of the whole thing.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Overview</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Here’s the Apple Intelligence marketing page.</a> Lots of pics!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Here’s the Apple Intelligence press release.</a> It’s an easy read too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Apple Intelligence is (a) a platform and (b) a bundle of user-facing features.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The platform is Apple’s take on AI infra to meet their values – on-device models, private cloud compute, and the rest.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The user-facing features we can put into 5 buckets:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Generation/Summarisation.</strong> Bounded to avoid hallucination, deepfakes, and IP risks (no making a picture in the style of a particular artist).</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Agents.</strong> This is what underpins Siri: on-device tasks using high personal context. (They call it “orchestration.”)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Natural interfaces.</strong> Voice, handwriting, nodding/shaking the head with AirPods Pro.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Do what I mean.</strong> This is a combination of gen-AI and traditional ML: recognising people in photos, knowing which notifications are important, spotting salient data in emails.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>World knowledge.</strong> Cautiously delivered as an integration with ChatGPT, think of this is web search++. Also used to turbo-charge text and image generation, if the users opts in.</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Bucket 1-4 are delivered using Apple’s own models.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Apple’s terminology distinguishes between “personal intelligence,” on-device and under their control, and “world knowledge,” which is prone to hallucinations – but is also what consumers <em>expect</em> when they use AI, and it’s what may replace Google search as the “point of first intent” one day soon.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s wise for them to keep world knowledge separate, behind a very clear gate, but still engage with it. Protects the brand and hedges their bets.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are also a couple of early experiments:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Attach points for inter-op.</strong> How do you integrate your own image generation models? How could the user choose their own chatbot? There’s a promise to allow integration of models other than OpenAI’s GPT-4o. </li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Copilots</strong>. A copilot is an AI UX that is deeply integrated into an app, allowing for context-aware generation and refinement, chat, app-specific actions, and more. There’s the beginning of a copilot UX in Xcode in the form of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-empowers-developers-and-fuels-innovation-with-new-tools-and-resources/">Swift Assist</a> – I’d love to see this across the OS eventually.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A few areas weren’t touched on:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Multiplayer.</strong> I feel like solving for multiplayer is a prerequisite for really great human-AI collaboration. I feel like their app Freeform is a sandbox for this.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Long-running or off-device agent tasks.</strong> Say, booking a restaurant. That’s where Google Assistant ran to. But having taken a stab at this <a href="https://www.actsnotfacts.com/made/conversational-ui">in old client projects</a> I’m of the opinion that we’ll need whole new UX primitives to do a good job of it. (<a href="/home/2023/02/10/progress">Progress bars??</a>)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Character/vibe.</strong> Large language models have personality, and people love chatting with them. <a href="/home/2023/03/22/tuning">ChatGPT has a vibe</a> and <a href="https://character.ai">character.ai</a> is hugely popular… but nobody really talks about this. I think it’s awkwardly close to virtual girlfriend territory? Still, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character">Anthropic are taking character seriously now</a> so I’m hopeful for some real research in this area.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Refining, tuning, steering.</strong> Note that Apple’s main use cases are prompt-led and one-and-done. <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/applied-research-problems-2024/">Steering is a cutting-edge research topic</a> with barely-understood tech let alone UX; there are hard problems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Gotta leave something for iOS 19.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Architecture</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Someone shared the Apple Intelligence high level architecture – I snagged it went by on the socials but forget who shared, sorry.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/more/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-architecture.jpg">Here’s the architecture slide.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The boxes I want to point out so I can come back them in a sec:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Semantic index.</strong> This must be something like a vector database with embeddings of all your texts, emails, appointments, and so on. Your personal context. <a href="/home/2024/05/31/camera">I talked about embeddings the other day</a> – imagine a really effective search engine that you can query by <em>meaning.</em></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>App Intents toolbox.</strong> That’s the list of functions or tools offered by all the apps on your phone, and whatever else is required to make it work. Apple apps now but open to everyone.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Orchestration.</strong> That’s the agent runtime, the part that takes a user request, breaks it into actions, and performs them. I imagine this is both for generation tasks, which will take a number of operations behind the scenes, and more obvious multi-step agent tasks using Siri.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What’s neat about the Apple Intelligence platform is how clearly buildable it all is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Each component is straightforwardly specific (we know what a vector databases is), improvable over time with obvious gradient descent (you can put an engineering team on making generation real-time and they’ll manage themselves), and it’s scalable across the ecosystem and for future features (it’s obvious how App Intents could be extended to the entire App Store).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A very deft architecture.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And the user-facing features are chosen to minimise hallucination, avoid prompt injection/data exfiltration, and dodge other risks. Good job.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Siri</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Siri – the voice assistant that was once terrible and is now, well, looking pretty good actually.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been immersed in agents recently.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Here’s my recent paper: <a href="/more/2024/lares/">Lares smart home assistant: A toy AI agent demonstrating emergent behavior</a>.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I’m seeing everything through that lens. Three observations/speculations.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>1. Siri is now a runtime for micro agents, programmed in plain English.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Take another look at the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence release</a> and look at the requests that Siri can handle now: <q>Send the photos from the barbecue on Saturday to Malia</q> (hi you) or <q>Add this address to his contact card.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">These are multi-step tasks across multiple apps.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The App Intents database (the database of operations that Siri can use in app) is <em>almost</em> good enough to run this. But my experience is that a GPT-3.5-level model is not always reliable… especially when there are many possible actions to choose from…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You know what massively improves reliability? When the prompt includes the exact steps to perform.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Oh and look at that, Siri now includes a detailed device guide:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Siri can now give users device support everywhere they go, and answer thousands of questions about how to do something on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The example given is <q>Here’s how to schedule a text message to send later</q> and the instructions have four steps.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Handy for users!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Look. This is not aimed at humans. These are instructions written to be consumed by Siri itself, for use in the Orchestration agent runtime.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Given these instructions, even a 3.5-level agent is capable of combining steps and performing basic reasoning.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s a gorgeously clever solution. I love that Apple just wrote 1000s of step-by-step guides to achieve everything on your phone, which sure you can read if you ask. But then also: Embed them, RAG the right ones in against a user request, run the steps via app intents. Such a straightforward approach with minimal code.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">i.e. Siri’s new capabilities are programmed in plain English.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Can I prove it? No. But I’ll eat my hat if it’s not something like that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>2. Semantic indexing isn’t enough. You need salience too and we got a glimpse of that in the Journal app.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Siri’s instruction manual is an example of how Apple often surfaces technical capabilities as user-facing features.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s another one I can’t prove: the prototype of the “personal context” in the semantic index.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s not just enough to know that you went to such-and-such location yesterday, or happened to be in the same room as X and Y, or listened to whatever podcast. Semantic search isn’t enough.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You also need salience.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Was it <em>notable</em> that you went to such-and-such location? Like, is meeting up in whatever bookshop with whatever person <em>unusual and significant?</em> Did you deliberately play whatever podcast, or did it just run on from the one before?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s tough to figure out.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Fortunately Apple has been testing this for many months: <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/12/apple-launches-journal-app-a-new-app-for-reflecting-on-everyday-moments/">Apple launched their Journal app</a> in December 2023 as part of the OS, and it includes <q>Intelligently curated personalised suggestions</q> as daily writing prompts.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like, you had an outing with someone, that kind of thing, that’s the kind of suggestion they give you. It’s all exposed by the Journaling Suggestions API.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Imagine the training data that comes from seeing whether people click on the prompts or not. Valuable for training the salience engine I’m sure. You don’t need to train with the actual data, just give a signal that the weights are right.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Again, nothing I can prove. But!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>3. App Intents? How about Web App Intents?</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">AI agents use <em>tools</em> or <em>functions.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Siri uses “App Intents” which developers declare, as part of their app, and Siri stores them all in a database. “Intent” is also the term of art on Android for “a meaningful operation that an app can do.” App Intents aren’t new for this generation of AI; Apple and Android both laid the groundwork for this many, many years ago.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Intents == agent tools.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It is useful that there is a language for this now!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The new importance of App Intents to AI-powered Siri provokes a bunch of follow-up questions:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What about intents that can only be fulfilled off-device, like booking a restaurant? In the future, do you need an app to advertise that intent to Siri, or could Siri index “Web App Intents” too, accessed remotely, no app required?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How will new intents be discovered? Like, if I want to use the smart TV in an Airbnb and I don’t have the app yet? Or book a ticket for the train in a country I’m visiting for the first time?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When there are competing intents, how will Siri decide who wins? Like, Google Maps and Resi can both recommend restaurants – who gets to respond to me asking for dinner suggestions?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How will personal information be shared and protected?</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I unpack a lot of these questions in my post about <a href="/home/2024/03/20/agents">search engines for personal AI agents</a> from March earlier this year. Siri’s new powers make these more relevant.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On a more technical level, in the Speculations section of <a href="/more/2024/lares/#speculations">my recent agent paper</a>, I suggested that systems will need an agent-facing API – we can re-frame that now as future Web App Intents.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In that paper, I started sketching out some technical requirements for that agent-facing API, and now I can add a new one: in addition to an API, any system (like Google Maps for restaurant booking) will need to publish a large collection of <em>instruction cards</em> – something that parallels Siri’s device guides.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m impressed with Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It will have taken a ton of work to make it so straightforward, and also align so well with what users want, brand, and strategy.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let me add one more exceptionally speculative speculation, seeing as I keep on accusing Apple of hiding the future in plain sight…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Go back to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> page and check out the way Siri appears now. No longer a glowing orb, it’s an iridescent ring on the perimeter of the phone screen.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Another perimeter feature: in iOS 18, when you push the volume button <a href="https://www.threads.net/@ken_isnerdy/post/C8EY7x2M2qg">it pushes in the display bezel</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I bet the upcoming iPhones have curved screens a la the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/03/02/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone-curved-screen-mobile-world-congress-2015/">Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge</a> from 2015.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or at least it has been strongly considered.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But iPhones with Siri AI should totally have curved glass. Because that would look sick.</p>
