  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, that’s it, a year without flying. I didn’t expect I would ever say that. We landed into Heathrow a year and a day ago, at the end of 2019, returning from Christmas with family in Australia.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Flying is a miracle and also flying increasingly sucks.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To itemise:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Legroom has been decreasing for 70 years. Planes continue to be noisy and crowded, a stressful environment. Each act of terrorism, happened or hindered, has added a permanent step to the security checks. Yes it’s necessary I guess, but my goodness it means that the airport experience is dehumanising and adds substantial time to the travel. Now there are masks too, the need to get tested before flying, potentially self-isolating at both ends, and of course the risk of an unexpected pandemic outbreak meaning a planned trip will be cancelled or you won’t be able to get home.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Flying is like broadcast TV (replaced by streaming), newspapers (unbundled and replaced by social media and the rest), PCs (smartphones), etc, where there’s a decades-long boiling frog transition until everybody looks up and collectively says, you know this is really bad, maybe we could just <em>not</em> do this, and do something else instead.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what happens instead of today’s air travel? What’s the <a href="/home/2020/12/29/adapting">long-term adjustment</a>?</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Business travel goes private.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can see business travel changing radically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">After 2020, as many trips as possible will replaced by Zoom (and gradually businesses and the ecosystem will reorganise such that this doesn’t add friction). Even after this particular pandemic is over, carbon accounting is only going to get more pervasive from here on out, and cutting down on flights is an easy win.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The remaining trips will still need to happen. But how? </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Business travel is sensitive to time, and not enormously sensitive to cash. Businesses care about comfort in-as-much as the employees are well rested at the other end, but the travel doesn’t need to be luxurious.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the current “high end” of business travel - cabins, nice lounges - doesn’t really help. The airport itself is still the big time cost.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What would it mean to re-think not just the flight, but the end-to-end experience?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe you could do away with security entirely if you had high trust in every passenger. Maybe you could route around big airports by using small ones.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I imagine is that every big company has its own airline of private jets. If you’re a Nike employee, you fly with a dozen other Nike employees. Result: No big airport faff, no security, you get picked up from home and driven straight to the plane at a local airfield where you board directly.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Inside the jet, it looks less like a plane and more like a co-working space crossed with a high-end hotel lobby. There are places to work and places to sleep. This is because the flight takes a little longer: you have to hop between regional airports to pick up/drop off passengers and refuel.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">All routes are dynamically calculated; there is no schedule. “Booking” a flight means putting in a request to be routed. The planes are always in the air.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(I imagine that there are actually only one or two underlying operators of the planes: it’s a virtual private fleet, except if the company is Google or Apple or something.)</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Cargo for the rest of us.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Without business travel, economy has to lean into the suckness.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I remember hearing somewhere that each cabin is priced to pay for the whole plane. Meaning: if any of first class, business class, or economy is full, the rest is gravy. So what happens in the future where the premium cabins get replaced by private jets? Those economy seats are going to get <em>really</em> squeezed in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Occasionally you see hear about those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_seat">standing seats</a> – but that’s just an incremental reduction of legroom. You’re going to hit limits of how many people can get on and off the plane in the turnaround time (or in an emergency), plus getting up and down aisles to feed people, etc. So let’s really go for it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Replace the top of the plane with a scaffold that can hold shipping containers (or some other new standard).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Fill the containers with standing seats, and load all meals and entertainment right by the seat. When it’s time to board, load people into the containers, and swap the old containers out for the new ones with cranes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(The old containers can be disinfected and restocked at your leisure, further reducing turnaround time.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Safety’s a doddle. Each container has its own emergency exit and slide. But there’s no route to the pilot or the other passengers. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For entertainment, give everyone VR headsets. Who needs a window or personal space when they feel like they’re on their own in an empty theatre?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Bonus points: provide a choice of containers with different seating. Standing seats in some, capsule hotel-style beds in others, salt-water baths/sensory deprivation pods in a few more.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If you like, shunt the containers around like cargo: making a flight connection is a matter of bundling passengers with the same destination together, and moving them directly between scaffold-planes at hub airports. Put a container on the back of a truck and take it all the way to the destination hotel, if you like.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Slow travel.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">While I might be able to tolerate being treated like cargo for an hour or two, I’m not convinced I would want to do it long haul – but I also don’t want to give up visiting long haul locations. So what gives?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If vacations weren’t so short, it wouldn’t be so important for long haul travel to also be <em>quick.</em> And maybe the trend towards remote work is relevant here.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Instead of taking a 2 week vacation, what if I took 6 weeks – but spent a month of that working remotely, or out of a regional office. I’d love to work during the day, but have a completely different country on my doorstep for evenings out and weekend hiking. Could that work? Has anybody tried negotiating something like this in their employment contract, and how would it be represented as a benefit?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Assuming that could work… perhaps travel by ship would be appropriate, or train, or airship. Dirigibles are due a comeback, I’m sure. It might take a few days or a couple weeks to cross the Atlantic, but treat it as working time with a Starlink internet connection, and maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Cruise ships are probably out, floating super spreader events that they are. So, avoiding those pandemic Petri dishes, maybe small yachts made just for coastal waters?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I have a completely unfounded hunch that self-driving yachts might provide much greater upside for AI than self-driving cars.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Perhaps, one day, there will be flocks of robot-piloted electric yachts on the open water, hopping auto-harbour to auto-harbour each summer around the Mediterranean, the whole season for a circuit; work and Zoom calls aboard, and after the day is done, while the boat recharges, a plate of frites with big crunchy crystals of salt, hot on the tongue, sitting in the navy light of the late evening on a wicker chair outside at the quayside cafe, the murmur of tourists and nomad workers and residents too, a cold glass of white, the dots of condensation gathering into larger beads, and coming together again, there, a droplet which momentarily catches and refracts the orange glow of the low setting sun, before it runs down the glass and down the stem and onto my finger where I feel its coolness.</p>
