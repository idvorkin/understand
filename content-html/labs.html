  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Following my thought experiment about the <a href="/home/2021/01/21/otl">Orthogonal Technology Lab</a> back in January, I have had a ton of conversations with people generously sharing their perspectives.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, here’s a collection of some contemporary research labs, as a way of thinking through which models I personally find most interesting. (I haven’t spoken with most of these, but they’ve come up in conversation. Apologies if anyone feels I have miscategorised their lab. I’m using categories only to aid my thinking.)</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As a recap, the goal of my imaginary lab is to</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">shift the discourse of what technology is capable of, e.g. finding business models for smart gadgets that don’t rely on collecting data or subscriptions; discovering new routes to interoperability for social platforms</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">don’t invent technology. Re-exploring old tech, and take a systems-thinking approach – create product prototypes, but also protocol drafts, Excel fictions, and so on</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">be independent and public yet commercial. The research programs should be visible and self-determined, but corporate involvement is important not just for $$$ but for amplification and access to ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As outputs to this process, new technology and new ventures may be inspired, and that’s the desire but not the purpose.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I was trying to figure out the model. That was one of my questions last time.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Independent research labs</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://otherinter.net">Other Internet</a></strong> is <q>an applied research organization in emerging technology.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I keep coming back and looking at this model. It appears to be open, self-directed research to explore a variety of areas (the website is a series of public strategy/insight decks), and then that leads into private commercial collaborations.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Though if I were to clone and adapt this model, I would need to figure out for myself what I wanted next stage in the research pipeline to be, and how to move people towards that.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://www.ethicalfutureslab.com">Ethical Futures Lab</a></strong> aims to <q>generate conversations among experts across disciplines [and] to build tangible examples of ethical futures.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Right now it’s a great biweekly newsletter, which I think is a smart approach: explore and build an audience, ahead of deeper engagements. So maybe it’s a baby <em>Other Internet?</em></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Unusual scientific institutes</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org">Qualia Research Institute</a></strong> is <q>a nonprofit research group studying consciousness.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">QRI appears to have the scaffolding of a research institute-shaped operation, some early research, and an advisory board of big names. It is currently pre-funding. It’s the “go big or go home” model and there’s a lot to be said for that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://scifieconomicslab.net">Sci-Fi Economics Lab</a>:</strong> <q>we nurture and support new, radical ways to think about the economy and economic policy.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s a place to bring unusual projects into the world – like <em>Witness,</em> which is a collaborative, speculative world building project, documented on its own Wikipedia. See for example, <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-history-of-witness/15008">The History of Witness</a>. The lab is also a venue for discussion and conferences, so they’re definitely prioritising influence.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This strikes me as simultaneously the most bonkers result of grant funding culture and <em>also</em> a lab in its purest form: there is a barely discernible but real phenomenon on the lab bench, and a group of people have convened to figure out what it is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://dynamicland.org">Dynamicland</a>.</strong> <q>Our mission is to incubate a humane dynamic medium.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The most fully-fledged public, independent, consumer technology research lab that I’m aware of. It’s a grand experiment, and a physical environment, aiming to discover the next paradigm of computing. I mean, it’s amazing. But I suspect that nobody except the founders (Bret Victor! Alan Kay!!) could have established it.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Memberships</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://www.ideocolab.com">IDEO’s CoLab</a></strong> <q>connects organizations to shape technology’s impact on the world. Together, we design the future.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">CoLab runs a number of different time-limited research programmes (e.g. Mixed Reality or Circular Economy) and corporates pay to set challenges to the research, take part in the collaborations, and have first dibs on the output. There is also a venture building element.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html">Fast Forward Labs</a>,</strong> owned by Cloudera since 2017, is <q>an applied machine learning research group.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">From what I understand, companies would subscribe to quarterly research reports about opportunities in machine learning, plus illustrative prototypes. <a href="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com">Here’s the blog</a> and <a href="https://experiments.fastforwardlabs.com">here are the experiments</a>. It appears to continue in a research-led and member-value-add fashion for Cloudera and its clients.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Is this model still viable or did it only fly because true understanding of machine  learning was, back then, very rare?</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Agency style</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://oio.studio">oio studio</a></strong> is (according to the Twitter bio): <q>A creative studio designing future products and interaction.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When agencies are able to maintain their own culture, beyond client engagements, they’re able to maintain a research-like vibe. I don’t know these folks, but the public portfolio is one of wildly playful and imaginative experimental products, and that will buy them space to continue to explore the same territories even when working with clients, and permission to carry the ideas out into the world again.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For me, this isn’t quite what I mean by a research lab, but there’s a similarly of spirit and lot to learn from.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Startup studios</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not including startup studios in my list. I think that if the <em>goal</em> is to spin out startups, either for yourself or for corporate partners, then</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the necessary “lean startup” approach pushes towards commercial viability too early, which is antithetical to the approach of orthogonal research; and</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">with startups, you tend to not show your working, which makes it harder to shift the public discourse (unless the startup is wildly successful).</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">However…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One exception, as it’s come up many times, and the model is intriguing:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com">Ink &amp; Switch</a>.</strong> <q>We are an industrial research lab working on digital tools for creativity and productivity.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">From the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/archive/rdlab-concept-sketch.pdf">March 2015 pitch deck</a> (pdf), this is a lab with a high cadence of rapid research and prototyping projects, each of which are written up publicly and in detail. For example <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/muse-studio-for-ideas.html">this exploration in sketching ideas on tablets</a> was, based on the response to the published write-up, spun out as the startup <a href="https://museapp.com">Muse</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(I’m not including “venture building as a service” companies here either. What I’m focusing on is where direction precedes funding, and the IP isn’t entirely owned by the client.)</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Corporate</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://space10.com">SPACE10</a></strong> <q>is proudly supported by and entirely dedicated to IKEA - working as an independent research and design lab.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As a lab, it’s highly collaborative, and appears to operate by making precise interventions within broad themes. For example the <a href="https://space10.com/project/everyday-experiments/">Everyday Experiments</a> research programme (which is about technology in the home) includes this wonderful collaboration: <a href="https://www.amostimioyedeji.com/light-gestures">Light Gestures</a>. As a research study into how to interact with smart lights, it’s thoughtful (great breakdown of the interaction) but accessible (lots of animated GIFs!). When you have enough of these experiments to pepper the theme, you’re really getting somewhere. There are also public research reports and a fellowship programme.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd">BBC R&amp;D</a></strong> and specifically the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/sections/internet-research-and-future-services">Internet Research and Future Services (IRFS) team</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s something powerful about researching and prototyping new ways to do storytelling in an organisation which is always looking for new ways to tell stories.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Artistic</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="http://schoolofma.org">School of Machines.</a></strong> <q>We develop unique programs to teach the latest technologies while simultaneously questioning their usage, the world around us, and ourselves.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I find this model fascinating. It’s primarily a teaching organisation, to enable artists with new tools and new perspectives, but the <a href="http://schoolofma.org/projects.html">projects</a> are provocative.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="https://freeport.institute">Freeport.</a></strong> <q>An independent study and production program led by artists.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Each “lab” has a duration, a theme, and an artistic lead, of sorts, but is mainly <q>a place to either expand your existing work and research, or test new ground.</q></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Setting out to encounter new problems</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Generally I’ve not been looking back in time because the context around R&amp;D has changed so much. But I do think a lot about the historic <strong>artist in residence</strong> programmes at both Bell Labs and Xerox PARC. These paired artists (animators, poets) with engineers and found new ways to see the world, and new applications of technology.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To read more about that, see <strong><a href="/home/2015/10/13/art_x_tech">my heavily-linked post about Art + Tech (2015)</a>.</strong> <em>(I’ve also given that post as a talk a few times, always internally at companies. There are a lot of pictures and not many conclusions so it’s a good lunchtime sort of thing. Get in touch if you’d be interested.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I read a tweet the other day (I wish I could find it) which asked why it was CERN that came up with the web, and DARPA the internet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Both of these places, suggested the tweet, came up against problems that nobody else had encountered yet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I think that’s one of the jobs of a lab, and it’s why working with artists works, and why you need both space for orthogonal research but <em>also</em> a way to engage with corporates or audiences with their own challenges: your goal is put yourself in a position where you face new challenges, and then report back.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">If forced to choose…</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">No conclusions. Lots to learn from the above.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On the corporate side, <em>SPACE10</em> is impressive. Though my own preference would be for something smaller and more opinionated.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>IDEO’s CoLab</em> has managed to pull off corporate collaboration, and that’s amazing. They have the advantage of being able to cross-sell, and they’re also able to bring their valuable training capabilities. What if an agency or a design consultancy were a partner in a lab?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think the <em>Other Internet</em> model is fascinating. And the membership model of <em>Fast Forward Labs.</em> I wonder about how to blend the two, and whether I could make the economics  work.</p>
