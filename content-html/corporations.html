  <h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">1.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are these cars around London that seem a bit like Zipcar - the car sharing service - <a href="http://blog.drive-now.co.uk/2014/12/01/drivenow-car-parking-made-easy/">but you can leave them anywhere.</a> Or at least, in most parking bays. So they kind of float around. The app tells you where the nearest car is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which is like Uber with no drivers?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How far could this go?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">No parking bays. I know Zipcar give you credit for getting the car cleaned. Or at least they used to. Could that be included… and gradually raise the credit you get until somebody is motivated to do the cleaning?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And to get them repaired? What if you get credit for car maintenance?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is why I’m into the idea that <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2014/12/22/ramble_about_bitcoin">companies are resource allocation markets.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What if the company doesn’t even supply any cars, just the marketplace. You get credit if you supply cars. Or rather, you get car-marketplace-currency, which is itself a fraction of the ownership of the marketplace, and the value of your share goes up as the entire system is utilised.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What else could this be applied to?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m playing with a startup idea at the moment that involves inventory and many concession stands, each of which need to be staffed. So I treated this as a toy… what if Bitcoin was used for resource allocation, what then? If someone supplied a concession stand, they would get paid in credit. If some staffed a stand, they would receive a wage in credit. If someone repairs a stand: credit.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Credit is backed by a certain number of shares in the company, so they’re worth something. When somebody purchases some of the inventory, that’s profit for the company; when that dividend is paid out, it is paid in proportion to the shares, and so the credit can be exchanged for dollars.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This would be simple, using Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then I asked myself: What would be the benefits of running the business like this?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Twofold:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Currently, a business like this would track its assets, liabilities, etc, using double-entry book-keeping. The prepared accounts are used to manage the business and allow it to invest in more assets and achieve more income. But the accounts are a <em>model.</em> They’re a map of the territory, not the territory itself. They’re hard to maintain, and they don’t integrate well with the business.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But use Bitcoin? There is no book-keeping because your activities in running the business are the same as recording it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">More importantly for a startup business: The job of finding the right prices can be thought of like game balancing… like finding the right cost of wheat in the economy of Farmville. We know how to do that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The accounts - and the business model itself - become something that can be iterated in code to achieve financial growth, just like A/B testing the code of a website to get user growth.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Okay, this is a long way off. The costs of setting up this system would be prohibitive. But when someone makes the tools…</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">2.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So here’s a classic long read for the holidays: <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/">A Brief History of the Corporation: 1600 to 2100.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(…which was last in my head when I used to write weeknotes at Berg, back in <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2011/06/21/week-315/">week 315.</a>)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The piece ends by speculating what happens after the traditional corporation is a spent force…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>And when that shift happens, the Schumpeterian corporation, the oil rig of human attention, will start to decline at an accelerating rate. Lifestyle businesses and other oddball contraptions — the solar panels and wind farms of attention economics — will start to take over.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Without realizing it, the hundreds of entrepreneurs, startup-studios and incubators, 4-hour-work-weekers and lifestyle designers around the world, experimenting with novel business structures and the attention mining technologies of social media, are collectively triggering the age of Coasean growth.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Coasean growth? <q>Coasean growth is fundamentally not measured in aggregate terms at all. It is measured in individual terms. An individual’s income and productivity may both actually decline, with net growth in a Coasean sense.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t know what this means. But it makes me wonder.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The author names “Coasean growth” after the Nobel prize-winning economist Ronald Coase: <q>He is best known for his work on transaction costs, social costs and the nature of the firm.</q></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">3.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Why do companies exist? In <a href="http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~jsfeng/CPEC11.pdf">The Nature of the Firm</a> (1937), Ronald Coase put it down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost">transaction costs.</a> In short, companies exist because it’s cheaper to have an organisation that does the necessary activity internally than to use the free market outside it. Why? Because using the market - the price mechanism - itself has costs.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s <a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/hubbard/htm/research/ec174/lectures/3coase.htm">a summary of Coase’s paper:</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>There are costs to using the price mechanism for coordinating economic activity. ‘transaction costs’ or ‘marketing costs’</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For example, if you want someone to carry your goods from the warehouse to your shop, first you have to find someone. That’s tough. It’s easier when lots of people who need carriage and lots of people who <em>provide</em> carriage come together – on a website or in the Yellow Pages. That’s a <em>marketplace.</em> But at a certain threshold, it’s easier still to just employ those people.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Firms exist to economize on the cost of coordinating economic activity.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Firms are characterized by the absence of the price mechanism.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This insight is old, but it makes my head spin.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Because it has two implications.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">First is that the internet has made much easier both forming marketplaces and negotiating prices. Amazon is a marketplace where buyers and sellers are brought together, and prices change fluidly. Uber has a bottled marketplace: It doesn’t employ its drivers, but they transact via Uber. And pricing is dealt with half by algorithm (increase the price till there are enough drivers) and branding (passengers never negotiate).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So as markets and pricing get easier still, firms can get much smaller – ad hoc value chains assembled out of code and culture, barely anyone working at the company at all.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Though we have to ask: If online marketplaces are so efficient, how can Amazon afford to buy the third party book sellers on their platform? There must be some efficiencies to being inside the firewall of the firm.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The second implication is that the firm, no matter how small, can have a kind of hinterland of value providers - a community of users who post pictures, drivers who transport passengers - who, although technically not inside the firm, are as part of it as a spider’s web is part of the spider, or a beaver’s artificial lake is part of the colony.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If the firm is thought of as contouring transaction costs, and these costs are radically lowered…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And if…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Not only are we realising that functions that used to be part of a firm are now outside it,</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>but also</em> that functions that have always been outside of the firm should actually be thought of as being part of it - for instance, realising that the community of a website should be rewarded like workers or owners, such as when reddit is giving partial ownership of its company to its users - then we need a new understanding of what a firm <em>is.</em></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">4.</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s some kind of fight online about some kind of technology something something. Dunno.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But in a smart piece asking people maybe to just chillax, <a href="https://medium.com/message/an-open-letter-to-everyone-involved-in-the-tor-fight-9c235918a7fd">Quinn said something that caught my eye:</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>This age has put a group of maladjusted geeks, of which I would happily count myself one, into an historical role of giving input into what human agency will mean long after we’re all dead.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yup.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We should take that seriously.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, y’know, the idea that a corporation - an organisation for orchestrating human endeavour to deliberate ends - an entity invented in the 1600s, and entity which BY ITS INESCAPABLE LOGIC forces us into mass production, mass consumption, mass media, alienation and the loss of individuality, and all kinds of ugly inhuman shit… the idea that we can re-invent the corporation, and create new forms of it: That’s interesting.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The idea that we might create a type of organisation which is empowering, has local value which doesn’t mean everything gets coerced into the value of giant companies, is smaller, can be interrogated and critiqued because it’s just code, that avoids the priesthoods of capital and law.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That a company might be a fuzzy-edged thing, where consumers are owners too…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back in the 1960s, the US Department of Defense funded the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">ARPANET which became the internet,</a> a made-out-of-whole-cloth dropped-into-history collection of protocols, practices, computers and networks, which I reckon probably had to be created all at once, because it couldn’t evolve, incubated just like that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And if DARPA came along now and said, Hey Matt, What Next?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’d say: Make a little bottle-city company that embodies all of this. Consumer-owners, internal currencies for resource allocation, corporate governance as executable code, doing an actual interesting tractable not-too-ambitious thing. Half co-op, half lifestyle business, half startup. Show what happens when we use capital, instead of capital using us. Do it simply and elegantly. Make a little nest of these companies.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then sit back and see what happens.</p>
