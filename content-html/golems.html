  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I often wonder what it would be like to have <em>“Open File”</em> and <em>“Save As”</em> for lightbulbs, online grocery stores, and messaging apps.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s hard to explain what files used to be like because they’ve changed so much.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Files used to be independent from apps.</strong> The way it used to work was that you would open a standard file format in an app, say a TIFF (image) or an RTF (text file) or an MP3, and you would play the file or edit it. And then you would open the exact same file in a different app for different capabilities.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Nowadays, if an app deals with files at all, you import files into the app and maybe export versions later, but the working doc itself is sealed in a library, or in a special format that nothing else can open.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Files used to be objects you could manipulate.</strong> Nowadays apps take care of versioning, and sharing, and often organising. But before, you would duplicate the file object directly, or drag it onto a chat window, or whatever. You can’t drag a Google Doc; the file isn’t a directly manipulable “file” so much as the visual depiction of a save point.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The upshot was that you owned your own files. And when a new application came along, it was exciting because you could try it out by using it with those exact same files, maybe switching back, maybe not.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So when I talk about files, I mean these</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">standard file types, shared between applications</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">where the file is the working document itself; it doesn’t have to be imported or exported</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">and the file icon is directly manipulated: shareable, printable, versionable, independent from the app.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(And yes, I know it was never as clear cut as this, but in an idealised kind of way.)</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">A file is a boundary object</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What is a file?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>There’s a technical answer.</strong> If you do the archeology and go back to source code from the 1970s, a file is a handful of properties: an address on disk; a size (i.e. how long to read the disk for); and some metadata like which owns these bytes, and do these represent an executable app or a document, and so on. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKwJzrSpgWO/">Here’s the code.</a> It’s less than a page. (Photo from <em>Lion’s Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition,</em> <a href="/home/2005/09/24/what_is_a_process">as previously discussed</a>.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But that’s not a definition that works for “documents” on cloud services, where a saved Google Doc is more likely to be a bundle of dynamic lookups from a database, rather than a run of bytes on disk. So…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>There’s the design answer.</strong> A file is what it looks like: an icon. There’s a fantastic oral history of the hamburger menu <em>(the three-lined menu button that you see in the top corner of a ton of websites),</em> and it goes all the way back to the Xerox Star, which was the first commercial computer to actually <em>have</em> windows, menus, a mouse, etc. The history includes commentary from Dave Canfield Smith who mentions <q>icons, which I’d invented at PARC for my thesis.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And he makes the distinction between file icons and the hamburger menu, THUS:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-hamburger-icon-from-the-people-who-were-there/" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Dave Canfield Smith" data-title="An oral history of the hamburger icon (Dale Berning Sawa)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t understand the fascination with the hamburger menu symbol, because it’s not even an icon–it’s just a symbol. Icons had both visual and machine semantics, whereas this menu button had only the former. You don’t do anything with a menu. It just sits there on the screen. You poke at it and a menu pops up, you move the cursor away and the menu goes away. That’s all it does. <strong>An icon is an object in a metaphoric world that you can do things with in the real world,</strong> the world that is being modeled.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Dave Canfield Smith, <cite><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-hamburger-icon-from-the-people-who-were-there/">An oral history of the hamburger icon (Dale Berning Sawa)</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s the key quality. Files are meaningful to computers, but they are <em>also</em> meaningful to users, and <em>both</em> can manipulate the same object. The two of you inhabit different worlds, but you’re talking about the same thing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a great paper from Microsoft Research called, simply, <strong>What is a File?</strong></p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/what-is-a-file/" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Microsoft Research" data-title="What is a File? (ACM CSCW 2013)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For over 40 years the notion of the file, as devised by pioneers in the field of computing, has been the subject of much contention. … we suggest that files continue to act as a cohering concept, something like a ‘boundary object’ between computer engineers and users.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Microsoft Research, <cite><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/what-is-a-file/">What is a File? (ACM CSCW 2013)</a></cite></footer>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A <em>boundary object</em> is a term from sociology. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_object">From Wikipedia:</a> boundary objects <q>have different meanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of translation.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The user can tell the computer what to do with a file without having to know the details of the inode structure or how to program their instructions; the computer can make a file available to a user without having to anticipate every single goal that a user may have in mind.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The “boundary object” quality of a file is incredibly empowering, magical really, one of the great discoveries of the early decades of computing.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">A file is what you put in the golem’s mouth</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The file made sense for desktop computers and bytes stored on disk. What could the file be now, in the era of the cloud and smart devices?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a clue, I think, in this kids’ toy, the <a href="https://www.yotoplay.com/pages/player">Yoto Player</a>: <q>A carefully connected screen-free speaker. Made for children, controlled with physical cards and playing only the audio content you want them to listen to.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s cute!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It reads bedtime stories!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Kids “program” it by inserting a card!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">My niece has one of these. She loves it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What neat is that you can <a href="https://www.yotoplay.com/pages/makeyourown">make your own cards</a>. I’m guessing the cards are just blank playing cards with a RFID tag inside. You program each card using a phone app. Once programmed, Yoto Player will play the relevant audio or podcast, and show pixel graphics on the front of the device.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT ALSO you can draw on and decorate the card, and you can keep them in a <a href="https://www.yotoplay.com/collections/accessories/products/portfolio-card-holder">snazzy green wallet</a>. So you can match the cards with interests, put educational ones with your school stuff, fun ones with different toys, private ones with your diary, keep some back for treats… all that good stuff. And all without Yoto having to pre-decide what kids might want to do (and having to design an app to do all of it).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Yoto Player is a golem.</strong> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">golem</a>, the <q>animated anthropomorphic being that is created entirely from inanimate matter</q> from ancient Jewish folklore. A statue, an ancient robot, but not autonomous. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Wikipedia" data-title="Golem">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It was believed that golems could be activated by an ecstatic experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet forming a “shem” (any one of the Names of God), wherein the shem was <strong>written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth</strong> or in the forehead of the golem.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Wikipedia, <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">Golem</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If you think of apps, or executables, as essentially inanimate clay - code which is pure potential, and brought to life by the loading of the user’s own file - then the file is the <em>shem,</em> or rather a generalised kind of shem, not a divine name as such, but a set of instructions, inserted into the mouth.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Now go and read Ted Chiang’s sci-fi short about golems and software <a href="https://ia802706.us.archive.org/33/items/TedChiangSeventyTwoLetters/Ted_Chiang_72_Letters.pdf">Seventy-Two Letters</a>.)</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Maybe lightbulbs can be golems too</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I have 1 (one) smart plug. I used it to control the Christmas tree lights (so I didn’t have to reach back on the floor twice a day) then nabbed it to control a lamp across the room from my desk. Currently it has been requisitioned to monitor the power usage of a water pump: I’m concerned there is a slow leak and the pump is switching on at odd times in the night. The plug will confirm this for me.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I would love to encode these configurations, and more, onto cards: the name, the room, who can use it, maybe some power user features such as where logs are sent, and how alerts are dispatched, and so on. These cards, physical or virtual, would live in a stack somewhere (on my bookshelf or in a shared Dropbox), and I could swap back and forth, and other family members would be so empowered too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>What about lightbulbs?</strong> Lighting scenes are a pain to create. A standard “file” for lights, not just bulbs but whole setups, would allow for</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">having different scenes for summer and winter, packed and unpacked at the turning of the season</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">giving away carefully created scenes in magazines and online – maybe you could get a movie director’s tuning colour temperatures to use when you’re watching on of their films</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">making a “virtual home” app, so I can create the lighting scene file in the app, maybe on behalf of a friend who hasn’t nerded out about the topic, and then share it with them (or debug it with them, texting the file back and forth).</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Do I literally mean that the lightbulb needs a little slot like the golem’s mouth, into which you insert your instructions stamped on microfiche? I’m tempted but no. But metaphorically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>What about an online grocery store?</strong> If my preferences and purchase history were a file, it would make it a ton easier to switch from one store to another. But that’s just export/import, service portability.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What makes the file, as a metaphor, so magical is that <em>other, unexpected software</em> can open the same thing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what I’m imagining is a <em>“Let’s Go Vegan”</em> app which loads the grocery file, deletes any meat and dairy from my purchase history (so I don’t get tempting recommendations) and seeds my shopping basket with a starter pack.  Or a <em>“Shop Local”</em> campaign that looks at my purchases and sets up accounts (and regular orders) with appropriate neighbourhood stores – or vice versa, if the supermarket can beat them on price and that’s what I want!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The trick is that these aren’t apps calling an API, because an API is bespoke to every store, and it’s not a matter of export/import because that misses the point of the file being a shared object that multiple different apps operate on simultaneously: a genuine shared file.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(APIs mean that a healthy ecoystem is a tough N^2 problem: every service needs to be tested with every other service. Shared files reduce this to an N problem. Each service needs to be tested with precisely one other thing, the file spec.)</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">What does it mean to have a file for a cloud service?</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m afraid this opens up more questions than it answers.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If it <em>were</em> possible to <em>“Save”</em> from WhatsApp and <em>“Open”</em> in Signal, then where is the user’s metaphorical filesystem kept, given it needs to be always available?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How is the “file” (whatever it is) kept up to date, given that files where invented for documents, which are punctual in time, versus cloud services which have streams which run and run?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How do you have standard file formats that don’t also prevent new interfaces and new metaphors?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How does this sit alongside <em>protocols</em> which, in the context of video conferencing services, might be a way to have <a href="/home/2020/10/14/protocols">interop, cross-platform presence, and dialtone</a> and video calls.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s pretend I somehow got to run my <a href="/home/2021/01/21/otl">Orthogonal Technology Lab</a> – this is research programme #1. There’s no new technology here. Just a series of ideas to explore that seems like they might unlock a tech ecosystem with good values, and the trick is to chase it down with small-scale prototypes, to begin with, and then speculative specification docs, and sketches of business models, etc, publishing it all, and using the whole activity to demonstrate to both founders and policy-makers that another future is possible, basically continuing the pile up the whole edifice until someone decides to come along and do it.</p>
