  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>I was invited to speak to the cohort of the <a href="https://www.summerofprotocols.com">Summer of Protocols</a> research program, and took the opportunity to build on last year’s essay about <strong>protocol fiction</strong> and think about adoption and the links with design fiction.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Summer of Protocols is an 18 week program to explore, catalyse, and broaden the discourse around protocols. <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@protocolized/introducing-the-summer-of-protocols-cohort">Here’s the cohort.</a>)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>The session was a talk, workshop, then afterparty discussion.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>The essay version of my talk follows. I’ve added some notes from the discussion at the end.</em></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Protocol fiction: recap</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How could you end up with new infrastructure, such as a national drone delivery network, or an ecosystem of biannual health checks based on MRI and AI – <em>without</em> being a government or a giant corporation?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One answer is to grow like the internet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">First you imagine a future network of actors with aligned incentives.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then you define a <strong>protocol</strong> that explains how to work together, even when the network is tiny, with incentives for non-actors to join the actor network. (When ARPANET launched it had 4 nodes.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(A certain kind of protocol is a technology of cooperation, and I’ll use it in that sense here.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A couple potential benefits of a protocol are</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">permissionless innovation – anyone can get involved, and anyone can create new <em>ways</em> to get involved</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">new commons – where there’s interop, mutual cooperation, and wide participation, everyone benefits without the gatekeeping of value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the challenge is getting started.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So last year I wrote about <a href="/home/2022/08/11/casi">protocol fiction for speculative infrastructure</a>, and the point of that fiction is to articulate</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>belief</strong> - by way of showing a plausible path to a reference implementation of the minimum viable network</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>desire</strong> - a compelling visualisation of this future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Today I want to talk about belief and desire.</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Stop-energy lurks like a parasite within the organisation</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I was taken with this cybernetic description of an aircraft factory from sci-fi author Bob Shaw (in his collection <em>Tomorrow Lies in Anguish).</em></p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tomorrow-Lies-Ambush-science-fiction/dp/0330244434" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Bob Shaw" data-title="Pilot Plant (1966)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An aircraft factory is a machine for producing aeroplanes and it may be disastrous to attempt to improve production by piecemeal tinkering with individual departments - one must seek out in all its ramifications, and destroy, the machine for stopping the production of aeroplanes, which lurks like a parasite within the organisation.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Bob Shaw, <cite><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tomorrow-Lies-Ambush-science-fiction/dp/0330244434">Pilot Plant (1966)</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It shifted my pov. I can now imagine that a system - a factory, an organisation, an ecosystem - is autonomous, its own entity, and I am there to facilitate and to garden.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In the protocol world, one of the best practitioners of ruthlessly rooting out stop-energy is Dave Winer, creator of both RSS and podcasting – which wasn’t just protocol design but also community/network bootstrapping.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Winer distilled his lessons into this typically straightforward, classic essay: <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html">Rules for standards-makers</a> (2017).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are 18 rules. I’ll pick out 8.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Rule #1: Interop is all that matters</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Software matters more than formats (much)</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Users matter even more than software</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>One way is better than two</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>If practice deviates from the spec, change the spec</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Freeze the spec</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Developers are busy</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Praise developers who make it easy to interop</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s worth a close read. The first rules are about creating belief: working code, social proof, etc.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then the later ones are about reducing friction.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I think Winer doesn’t say (because he’s so good at it, and therefore takes it for granted) is that you also have to create <em>desire</em> and a kind of <em>gregarious desire</em> – people have to easily see the value and want to get involved! And they have  to tell their friends!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The final rule, <q>praise developers,</q> is a nod to that: positive feedback and imitation is part of human nature.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So how should we think about desire with specs and protocols?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Design fiction creates both belief and desire</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The practice of Design Fiction (as established by Julian Bleeker) is responsible for all kinds of very public, charismatic visions of the future.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/patently-untrue" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Bruce Sterling (Wired)" data-title="Patently untrue: fleshy defibrillators and synchronised baseball are changing the future (2013)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Design fiction is the deliberate use of diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Bruce Sterling (Wired), <cite><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/patently-untrue">Patently untrue: fleshy defibrillators and synchronised baseball are changing the future (2013)</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Kickstarter videos: they follow the aesthetic tropes of design fiction. <em>(My favourite is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/prtyny/disco-dog-the-smartphone-controlled-led-dog-vest">Disco Dog from 2015</a> – once you see the dog in the context of the street, it’s so real, it’s so compelling…)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s something about a gorgeously shot prop in its context of use that makes you trust and want enough to open your wallet.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Of course that’s not all design fiction is. To unpack how it works as a practice and its wider effects, I recommend Matt Ward’s essay <a href="https://medium.com/@matthewward/design-fiction-as-pedagogic-practice-9b1fbba7ae2b">Design Fiction as Pedagogic Practice</a> (2013). <em>(I first encountered the deliberate use of fiction in design because of Ward, <a href="/notes/2006/02/scifi/">back in 2006</a>.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To highlight just some of his points:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>All design is ideological</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Fiction as a testing ground for reality</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Normalise to persuade.</q> And: <q>Prototyping banality allows for the imaginative leap it takes to place one self in a future context.</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Think through making</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Things live in their interaction with their context</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I take from this is</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">a reminder that the use of narrative is part of the design/development loop</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the ability to persuade - to create <em>desire</em> - is a intentional selector in this evolution.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Design operates in the market. The ability of artifacts to persuade is what we want.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A protocol network, same same!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Hence protocol fiction.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’d like to add something:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Material artifacts have an ability to <em>enroll and align</em> different tribes in a way that text doesn’t. The goal is to make <em>“boundary objects”</em> - artifacts that self-translate for all kinds of different tribes, and allow these actors to communicate with one another, even when they’re speaking different languages.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Think of the magical role of self-evident prototypes to align engineering, designers, users, MBAs, and so on. Like that, but projected into the future.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Gabriel Tarde’s belief and desire</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I should give the origin of these terms I keep using.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">At the bottom of internal phenomena, whatever they are, the analysis pushed to the limit will never discover more than three irreducible notions: belief, desire, and their point of pure application, pure sense.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Gabriel Tarde, La croyance et le desire (1880)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I haven’t forgotten them since <a href="/home/2012/03/08/belief_and_desire">I first heard them</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Steven Shaviro has written about <a href="http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=203">the sociology of Gabriel Tarde</a> (2003).</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Tarde denies the existence of higher-level entities … There is no such thing as social laws and regulations, social norms, social impositions. There are only power relations among individuals. Certain individuals impose on others; certain individuals are imitated by others. Social coherence is merely the result of imitation on a mass scale, together with raw power impositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">By a similar argument, it cannot possibly be the case that all hydrogen atoms are uniform and interchangeable. <u>The only explanation for the apparent uniformity of nature is that one particular hydrogen atom dominated the others, forced them to obey it, or induced them to imitate it.</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><u>The ultimate motivating forces that move all of the world, whether human beings in society, thoughts in a single brain, or hydrogen atoms in a gas, are according to Tarde belief and desire. There’s nothing else.</u> Rocks and stars, indeed atoms themselves, believe and desire just as we do. At the other extreme, things like ideologies and customs and social classes and bureaucracies can be explained merely as statistical aggregations of particular beliefs and desires, amplified by mass imitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/home/2012/04/30/belief_and_desire">(Also quoted here.)</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I find this such a brutal and mind-opening lens.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Beyond <em>thinking through making,</em> this is what protocol fiction must achieve.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I want to show three levels for building belief and desire, at different scales.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">1. Microscopically, there was Stripe</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The story of Stripe, the internet payments platform, was told in Businessweek: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-01/how-two-brothers-turned-seven-lines-of-code-into-a-9-2-billion-startup">How Two Brothers Turned Seven Lines of Code Into a $9.2 Billion Startup</a> (2017).

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I remember those lines: <q>all a startup had to do was add seven lines of code to its site to handle payments</q> – it was neat!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The more jaw-dropping moment, for me, was when they were still called <em>“/dev/payments”,</em> and half of their page was given over to this: </p>

<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Belief – you could see how to integrate this; and</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Desire – dollar signs in your eyes. All kinds of futures appearing in-front of you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what’s the smallest way to have that kind of experience?</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">2. With our macroscope we can see the Consensus Cosmogony and other future histories</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back in the 1950s that was a belief - or rather a common and unstated understanding - about humanity’s future in space.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To me, there’s a big role for sci-fi’s established future history, the Consensus Cosmogony, <a href="/home/2015/02/02/consensus_cosmogony">summarised here</a>:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The initial exploration, colonization, and exploitation of the solar system</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The first flights to the stars</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The rise of a Galactic Empire (aliens optional)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Galactic Empire at its height</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Decline and Fall of the Galactic Empire</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Galactic Dark Ages</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Galactic Renaissance</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Challenge To God (by <q>transcending matter and morphing into beings of pure energy, the end of time, and the investigation of the beginnings of new universes</q>)</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When people were sent into orbit, and then landed on the Moon, this was confirmation that we were on the path - if step 1, then steps 2 through 9, right? And it’s <em>exciting!</em> We <em>want</em> it to happen. That was the role of the sci-fi stories: propaganda creating desire.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Activities become easy when they align with a social consensus. Once established, you don’t get stop-energy from doing something that matches this future.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then given the Brownian motion of society, we collectively tend towards that future.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Think of Moore’s Law as another Schelling point in action.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are other social consensus futures: nuclear apocalypse, climate change… (I wrote in 2022 about <a href="/home/2022/02/09/apocalypsi">the story becoming destiny</a>.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s interesting that, as wild as the Consensus Cosmogony is, what makes it work is that there’s a pathway and the Space Race gave it plausibility. Belief as well as desire. It’s not enough to just imagine and articulate a future, you have to show there-from-here, at least so evangelists can hand-wave it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So: how do you give people a picture of the future? And how do you provide a plausible pathway there – with your protocol (or whatever) becoming a both required and inevitable step #1?</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">3. Vonnegut’s mind-opening team</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Another way of looking at this is that you need different types of activity, and not everyone is specialised at doing all of them.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In Kurt Vonnegut’s <em>Bluebeard,</em> the character Paul Slazinger writes a book: <em>“The Only Way to Have a Successful Revolution in Any Field of Human Activity.”</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Slazinger/Vonnegut puts forward that you need a <q>mind-opening team</q> of three sorts of specialists:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An authentic genius: <q>a person capable of having seemingly good ideas not in general circulation. ‘A genius working alone,’ he says, ‘is invariably ignored as a lunatic.’</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An intelligent person in good standing, <q>who testifies that the genius is far from mad. ‘A person working like that alone,’ says Slazinger, ‘can only yearn out loud for changes, but fail to say what their shapes should be.’</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An explainer. <q>‘He will say almost anything in order to be interesting or exciting,’ says Slazinger. ‘Working alone, depending solely on his own shallow ideas, he would be regarded as being as full of shit as a Christmas turkey.’</q></li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/home/2003/01/22/the_following_is">Full transcript here.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s not as obviously belief and desire but, I think, it’s a similar light on these different functions that are required.</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Design fiction and propaganda from Zurich Insurance in 2006</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Propaganda sounds like a dirty word, as does “advertising” to some people, but my favourite piece of persuasive design fiction probably <em>ever</em> is this Zurich tv spot from – well I don’t know exactly but it was uploaded to YouTube 17 years ago.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-ktjF2bXIo">Because Change Happens, Zurich TV ad from 2006</a> <em>(Youtube, 1 min).</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s a collection of short scenarios made mundane by being shown incidentally in an entirely believable near future:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">a commuter on prosthetic cyborg legs</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">auto-routing cars at a busy junction with no traffic lights</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">a transforming shop/cafe</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(Just as wild, in the minds of the advertisers, is the idea of old people snowboarding. Only 17 years ago!)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5UvMZyQrnY">Here’s a second ad</a> with vignettes including auto-inflating fall protection jackets for construction workers, and people in suits caring about mental well-being.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I do wonder: would there have been <em>any other way</em> to get salespeople, management, analysts, and partners thinking about algorithmic insurance for robot cars (which is now a thing) in the early years of the 2000s?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is belief, desire, and material artifact as boundary object, all wrapped up in one. (Though I think we kinda have a growing immunity to video nowadays. Working code is better.)</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Provocations for protocol design and protocol designers</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So if I could list some challenges for the designers of protocols, it would be to sit and imagine how to do the following - in ascending level of scale:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Creating belief and desire for your protocol.</strong> Beyond a reference design, what are some practical activities and potential artifacts as immediate next steps?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>What’s the protocol playbook?</strong> Looking across these artifacts and activities to create belief and desire, the startup world knows how to do this: there’s the lore of landing pages and the ability to measure and iterate of funnel analytics and A/B testing. What are the analogous tools in the protocol world?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Manifesting a protocol-focused consensus mindset.</strong> Right now, society believes that building the future is the province of (in descending order of effectiveness) corporations, the state, and - possibility - viral movements. These are all technologies of cooperation. That wasn’t always the case: we used to reach for protocols too. What’s the best first intervention to get society to think about protocols again?</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Today let’s think about the first challenge only.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe, as an exercise:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Consider a specific new protocol</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Briefly describe the future world</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Come up with 3 different activities/artifacts to build <em>and propogandise</em> belief and desire, with the purpose being to enrol new actors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Whiteboard these using <a href="https://www.tldraw.com">tldraw</a> <em>(go to the menu in the top left and hit File > New shared project. Then everyone can work on the same URL).</em> And we’ll come back to discuss in 15 minutes.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Notes from the workshop: topping up your gmail, and an annual holiday for archiving the dead</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not going to do a full write-up of the workshop here, except to note a two ideas that stuck in my head:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On a protocol for attaching escrow cash to email (to prevent spam): <em>“Topping up your gmail”</em> is a great way to frame a future behaviour and makes it entirely believable; and it is a <em>great</em> motivation to point out that people will no longer need to be scared of putting their contact details in public, because we’ve become so accustomed to being scared right now that we’ve forgotten.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On a protocol for grieving loved ones with digital technology: having a specific annual holiday for the ritual of <em>“archiving”</em> is beautiful, and running the first annual day ahead of the end of the program means that the ritual is already a reality before next year comes around.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well done to all four groups!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And from the discussion:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Not all design is the same. Some design is about meeting a need or a user goal. <strong>But some design is normative.</strong> It is design for the world as it should be, not as it is. Design fiction fits in the world of normative design.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Protocol fiction too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To riff on Ward’s framing, the <em>Summer of Protocols</em> is inherently ideological and protocols, as a technology of cooperation, if they are intended to grow, are evangelical.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So unpacking <strong>desire and belief</strong>, and then manifesting it, will be, I believe, part of the story of this summer program, if the researcher cohort is to achieve its goals.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Thank you for inviting me.</p>
