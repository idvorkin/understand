  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I like how <a href="https://natbuckley.co.uk/blog/">Nat Buckley, in their weeknotes</a>, casually refers to <strong>the Before</strong> and <strong>the After</strong>.  <a href="https://natbuckley.co.uk/2020/05/05/weeknotes-68-what-even-is-time/">For example</a>, <q>According to my watch I burn slightly more calories than on most days in the Before.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And it got me chatting on Twitter about what do we call the bit in the middle?</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Now, or the During</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The quarantine</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The lockdown <em>(that’s what we call it, here at home)</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And keeping in mind that <em>during</em> this period, many people have and will still die, and many people are suffering. And it’s super fucking brutal.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I don’t mean to brush over that reality, I want to acknowledge that it’s there, and that one of the characteristics of this period is the mental logjam of struggling with finding bread flour (for example) while also knowing that others are struggling in a much more significant sense.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway, I wondered what, in the future when we’re looking back, we’ll call the <em>“and”</em> between the Before and the After.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Punctuated equilibrium</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back in 2003 <a href="/home/2003/01/15/question">I asked</a>: <q>What do you call the bits between the equilibria in punctuated equilibrium?</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/punc-eq.html#summary">Punctuated equilibrium</a> is a model of evolution which says that a new species appears all in a rush and a muddle, but once it does appear it then becomes stable.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In the course of <a href="/home/2003/01/16/some_answers_to">collecting suggestions</a> I started thinking about <strong>habit-breaking days</strong>… I have routines not just because I’m set in my way, but because everyone <em>else</em> is set in their ways too. Changing up routines is hard for that reason.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But when everyone changes up their routines around you, changing your <em>own</em> routines becomes easier.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which led me to think that perhaps there are periods when we all change our habits <em>together.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like now.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Oh yes, some of the suggestions:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">liminal <em>(like, being halfway through a doorway)</em></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">phase shifts</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">little bangs</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the punctuation</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I guess I’ve been thinking about these intermediate periods for some time, and that’s why I’ve been fixating on it recently.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Habits in the Before and the After</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We used to have a regular big shop at the supermarket, and also pop in frequently pick up ingredients etc to fill out a particular meal.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now we get our groceries from a small set of local shops do delivery. It’s a rewarding way to do be connected to our changed community. The supermarket is for whatever they don’t carry. Meals are planned around available ingredients. Food waste, which was always a concern, is now a priority… and almost zero. I hope that continues.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I used to travel into town for meetings. I used to drink coffee on the train.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can’t see myself going back to travelling in the After. I’ve got back 2 hours a day and I won’t want to give that up.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And for everything from how I hang out with friends and family, to how I win work, to how I make time for creative projects, there was what I did in the Before, and there’s what I anticipate doing in the After…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…and there’s how I’m muddling along today.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Before, the After, and the muddle?</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">How it feels</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Kim Stanley Robinson, who writes incredible sci-fi utopias about Mars and future Californias and also post-climate-catastrophe Earth, had a piece in the New Yorker the other day: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-coronavirus-and-our-future">The Coronavirus Is Rewriting Our Imaginations</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I mean, read the entire thing, but I wanted to quote this bit because KSR is some kind of word-smith <em>magician</em> and his sentences and rhythm are <strong>transcendent</strong>. I’ll give you the lead-in first, but maybe if you’re in a place where you can, speak the second para out loud because it really really works.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Memento mori: remember that you must die. Older people are sometimes better at keeping this in mind than younger people. Still, we’re all prone to forgetting death. It never seems quite real until the end, and even then it’s hard to believe. The reality of death is another thing we know about but don’t feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(This is the bit to read out loud. Give the words some room to breathe. Vary the speed and the sustain.)</em></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So this epidemic brings with it a sense of panic: we’re all going to die, yes, always true, but now perhaps this month! That’s different. Sometimes, when hiking in the Sierra, my friends and I get caught in a lightning storm, and, completely exposed to it, we hurry over the rocky highlands, watching lightning bolts crack out of nowhere and connect nearby, thunder exploding less than a second later. That gets your attention: death, all too possible! But to have that feeling in your ordinary, daily life, at home, stretched out over weeks – that’s too strange to hold on to. You partly get used to it, but not entirely. This mixture of dread and apprehension and normality is the sensation of plague on the loose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So good.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway, what KSR puts his finger on is a couple of things,</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">that this pandemic is the prototype for a century of crises: water shortages, food scares, <q>a heat wave hot enough to kill anyone not in an air-conditioned space,</q> etc,</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">and that our shift into a new way of <em>feeling</em> about the world has now happened. We won’t and can’t return to our old habit of <q>knowing-but-not-acting</q>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Possibly, in a few months, we’ll return to some version of the old normal. But this spring won’t be forgotten. When later shocks strike global civilization, we’ll remember how we behaved this time, and how it worked. It’s not that the coronavirus is a dress rehearsal – it’s too deadly for that. But it is the first of many calamities that will likely unfold throughout this century. <strong>Now, when they come, we’ll be familiar with how they feel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Familiar.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">When this is all over…</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been thinking a lot about the After…</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">when I can go see cricket the cricket again (crowds)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">when I can browse the supermarket again (food security)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">when I can visit family (the risk of accidentally infecting older parents)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">when I can fly for holiday again (national borders as pandemic firebreaks)</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">and thinking to myself, <em>well, once we get through this…</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But what KSR unlocked for me with that word <strong>familiar</strong> is that the feeling of the lockdown is now becoming familiar. Familiar means habitual. Habits don’t change, not without another crisis on the same scale.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We’ve got our childcare routine, and our way of working from home. Our masks have arrived, we know when to wash our hands.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And what occurred to me, then, is that I’ve been thinking about this all wrong. There isn’t a Before, a lockdown, and an After. There’s only the Before, and the lockdown, and the lockdown will last forever.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">There is no After</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes there will be some loosening of restrictions. We’ll be able to return to school and work, at least for a bit until there’s a risk of a second peak and then the lockdown will tighten again for a while.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We’ll be able to visit parents, or go to events, but with masks, and maybe not in Covid season or something like that. We’ll carry immunity passports. We’ll have to pay attention to whether the cache of dried goods in the back of the cupboard is still in date, because we take food supply chains for granted any longer. The contact tracking apps will never be turned off, governments will say that it isn’t worth the risk, and we’ll all agree.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">National borders will close periodically, like the Thames Barrier – you’ll never go on holiday or travel for work without thinking of the 1% chance that you’ll be stranded for the duration. It may never come, and let’s hope it doesn’t, but we’ll always be watching out for that second peak, it will always be a few months in the future, shaping our present.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think about 9/11, almost 20 years ago. That emergency never ended either. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The lockdown itself will reduce in intensity somewhat, but the instruments of the lockdown will stay, and the psychic lockdown - the <em>feeling</em> of all of this - will stay too. It will feel familiar.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a bit in <em>Blue Mars</em> by Kim Stanley Robinson (him again) where the West Antarctic ice sheet collapses, and sea levels the world over rise dramatically.</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“How fast is it?” Nadia said. “Is it a tidal wave?”</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“No. More like a very high tide. That will never go away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And that’s how I think about the lockdown now. A high tide that won’t go out. It’ll come and go, a bit, but really this period is just an extreme phase in what we’ll find is the new normal.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Adjusting</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m coming to this realisation late, I know, others have been talking about the new normal for ages.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s helping me to think like this, because instead of waiting around - life on pause - thinking about how to pick things up when things return to how they were, or keeping my powder dry because things might be different again in the After, or saying <em>oh I’ll do that later when thing have settled down,</em> I can start adjusting right now instead.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can focus on finding new habits, and building my life and my practice in new ways. I’ll work on discovering new ways to make new routines easier, and joyful too, and as time goes on there will be opportunities to find new ways to enjoy family too, and even cricket somehow, but they won’t be the same as they were in the Before. And I’m going to start figuring these things out <em>now,</em> because there’s no point holding out to see what it’ll be like when this is over, because it won’t be over, there’s only the lockdown, the high tide isn’t going to go out, and there is no After.</p>
