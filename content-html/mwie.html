  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">About three weeks back, fellow traveller Tom Critchlow shared his annual notes on being an independent consultant: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/10/24/5-years/">5 years on the road: Thoughts on sustainable independence</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And: coincidence! I work via a consultancy vehicle called <strong>Mwie Ltd.</strong> I am its sole employee. Mwie was incorporated in October 2014 and issued its first invoice in November  2014, so that <em>also</em> puts me 5 years on the job. Happy work anniversary, I guess (which is absolutely not a thing although LinkedIn insists it is).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Inspired by Tom, I started writing a blog post retrospective. What I’ve been doing, what some highlights have been, etc.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I’d like to do more of.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What’s missing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What am I any good at.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Oh my god where is it all going anyway.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ok so (a) I shouldn’t have tried to write to write a retrospective on my own on a Friday night; and (b) wow it got way too personal, there’s no way I’m sharing it.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The thing is that for the past five years, I <em>haven’t</em> been talking about what I’m up to, and there <em>hasn’t</em> been a plan. My strategy has been</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">talk with interesting people about what I’m interested in</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">don’t chase too hard: allow as much time as necessary for win-win situations to make themselves obvious</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">only do interesting, stimulating work — but never just because I need it for the cash or positioning <em>(granted, it’s privilege to be able to be choosey like this, but I’ve previously worked to earn that)</em></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">no marketing except word of mouth: marketing can’t abide complexity. Crafting a message that will carry, any message, requires reifying my practice and I haven’t been ready to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That last point all about what we’d call in other contexts product-market fit. That hyphen is an arrow of influence that points both ways.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Marketing requires a view on what the market finds valuable; what will resonate. In my case, how clients will find and understand business value. Not only have I lacked up-to-date knowledge of what value I, personally, can unlock, but prematurely working on marketing will shape the product before it’s ready.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And what is the “product” here? Well it’s me, my practice — it’s some overlap of what I find stimulating, what I’m good at, and what helps me get future work which is the same but better. But can I <em>articulate</em> that? Not a chance.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So if I look at the last five years, the strategy has been</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">follow my nose</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">discover what I want, because I can’t articulate it</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">discover what the market wants, because I don’t know.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If it sounds like I’m starting from the ground floor here, I guess it’s because I am. BERG (the design consultancy turned tech startup I co-founded) shut its doors in 2014, and I carried on working on various loose ends well into 2015. My “voice”, needs, patter, platform, and intellectual interests had been mixed with the studio, in one incarnation or another, for 10 years. It’s… confusing. Moreover, I had been surrounded by some of the most talented, unique individuals I have ever met — and one of the jobs of a CEO is to do only what can’t be done by others.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">All of which means I came into my current five year stint as “Independent Consultant” (according to my LinkedIn) with very little real idea of what I was good at and what I wanted out of my work. And, if I’m honest, a bit afraid that the expectations of others — potential clients — would shape my practice into what <em>they</em> needed and thought I could offer, before I could figure that out for myself.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s call it product discovery and market discovery. Business-speak as camouflage for feelings.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I wish I could find the source of this quote. I remember reading Kevin Kelly relating something he heard from his mentor Stewart Brand:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We have time for three 15 year careers. In each career, you’ve got five years to learn and work your way into it. Then five years to do it as well as you can. Finally you have five years where you can offer a new spin from your own individual perspective.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think about this period I’m in as my second career. I’ve been in no hurry to figure out what it is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But… five years in. Maybe it’s time to finish the discovery chapter and focus on execution for a bit.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Where were we? Oh yes, Friday night a little over two weeks back. On my own at the kitchen table with my laptop and a class of red, writing a career  retrospective that was rapidly devolving into a career existential crisis.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s what I did.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I wrote down everything I would regard as a <strong>career highlight</strong> from the past five years, and looked to find themes.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then I went back to looked at <strong>extracurricular activities</strong> from the past five years. I’ve always got a side-project or two. Well, I decided, if they fit into one of my themes, they’re retrospectively now a work project.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I listed everything that I felt was missing. What do I wish I had done more of?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And then, at the end, there is this section: <q>If I met me, and was advising me on what to do, this is what I would say:</q> — and after answering that title I went to bed.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Before I go into the results of that personal career review, it’s worth saying why I separate myself from my consultancy, Mwie Ltd, even though the two are often the same.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s <strong>practical</strong> and means I can work with bigger clients. Incorporating means I can safely subcontract (which I’ve done frequently for clients) and relate to companies on the basis of product supplied rather than hours done.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can <strong>invest</strong> in assets. Through Mwie Ltd I have run a bookshop in a vending machine, and I’m building <a href="https://job.garden">Job Garden</a>. Both cost money. But because they stick to the consultancy, even if they don’t wash their face by their own account, they can be worth it for the marketing, creds, or capabilities benefits.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Separating the company bank account from my own provides a <strong>psychic buffer.</strong> For years I’ve paid myself a regular monthly salary. Company revenue goes up and down. Clients sometimes pay late. Sometimes there’s a good month and the company looks flush. But so long as there’s a six month runway in the bank, none of that affects my sleep.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You get what you do. Or rather, you get what others see that you do.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s funny. Jack and I gave an interview to the Daily Telegraph business section (I’m not even kidding) way back in 2007. I just went back and read it, and the advice in that article is exactly what I had to remind myself about that Friday night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071105181112/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/05/15/cbstart15.xml">Here’s the article:</a></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“We started turning down work,” says Webb, describing the duo’s slightly different approach to building a fledgling business. But Schulze and Webb had an unusual problem - when they spoke to potential customers they would get offers to design websites or graphic material. But that wasn’t what they meant by “design”. “Bits of plastic and microcontrollers,” says Webb, “the future world of products.” These were the things that excited them.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Friends advised two strategies. One: find a way to communicate to people what you do in language they can use with others (such as their bosses). Two: make things that encapsulate the kind of work you want to do and hope people discover them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And at the end of the article:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Do:</strong> Start with the smallest thing that’ll work. The learning you get from ‘doing’ is huge, it gives you pace, and big plans are always bigger than they look from the outside.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Don’t:</strong> Take work only for the money. You get what you do, so work that makes you unhappy is not progressive. And it’s better to structure the business so you don’t need the cash than take work that kills the opportunity of much better work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Bloody hell. Thank you very much <em>Jack-and-me-from-2007.</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">My personal career review includes some course-correction points.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not doing enough public speaking of the sort that I enjoy — I feel I’ve lost touch with my tribe, and I miss that.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And while the <em>function</em> of the work I’m doing is rewarding, and I enjoy and I’m good at it… I’m missing the opportunity to chase down intellectual avenues which — because of my individual perspective — fascinate me and I believe are important. I have a list of these.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I also have a couple of points which boil down to: this isn’t the consultancy, but do more of it!</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not going to share details on the above points if that’s ok.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Mainly, and this is what surprised me, when I looked back over five years of projects</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">there <em>are</em> indeed themes!</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the kind of value I can offer and <em>enjoy</em> is supported by credible previous work!</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I have opinions about the industry that I’m in, and what should be done better and differently!</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I would like to do more of those things!</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">None of this was necessarily going to be the case. So, good news.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You get what you do.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Long story short, I redesigned my website. Between other things that took two weeks and I put it live yesterday.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I thought about renaming. But switching away from Mwie Ltd felt like it would be inauthentic — it <em>is</em> just me, after all, operating as a limited company, and I have no intention of building it into another agency. Been there, done that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Secret origin: “Mwie” stands for <em>Matt Webb Import/Export</em> because when I was a kid, visiting family in Nairobi, we would pass all kinds of import/export businesses and I still remember them as exotic and mysterious. I always wanted one of my own. And so.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yet Mwie is a dumb name. So in the spirit of celebrating that which binds us, I figured I would lean in and put the expanded version on the homepage too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Actually writing the case studies was pretty simple. This isn’t a launch of a new offer. There’s nothing aspirational here, and no new positioning. All I’m doing — very incrementally — is reinforcing existing word of mouth marketing by stating exactly what I already say in person.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I just wrote down how I already talk about my projects.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Putting them in one place, and grouping them: that’s new.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Oh, and the design. I get my hands dirty with web design every year or two. It’s fun, although of course now I can’t see anything except what I think is wrong with it.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://interconnected.org/home/more/2019/11/mwie_com.png">Here’s a screen grab of the old mwie.com website</a> from November 2019. Single page. Useful mainly for the boilerplate which shows the company registration number.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s the new one:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="http://www.mwie.com">Mwie Ltd: Matt Webb Import/Export, est. 2014.</a></strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As always, I’m up for hearing your thoughts. There’s a contact page on the other side of that hyperlink should you wish to get in touch.</p>
