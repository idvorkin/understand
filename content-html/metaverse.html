  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Trends in tech come along every so often, co-opting and organising markets and sub-technologies around them like iron filings around a magnet. “Metaverse” is the latest, big enough that Facebook has renamed itself Meta to symbolise its enlarged focus. So I wanted to organise some of my own thoughts about what it is.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A trend is a fuzzy-edged phenomenon, a hyperobject touching on: products, protocols for inter-op, technology stacks, typical business models, and so on. So any definition is incomplete. The sharp end is the product experience, which is where adoption happens, and that drives everything else.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what is the product experience of the metaverse? Loosely I see it as having three essentials:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Immersive</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Multiplayer</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Economy</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Is it immersive?</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think about immersion on a spectrum. At one end you’ve got VR:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Full embodiment is 3D virtual reality, headsets, and sensors that detect muscle movement</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Slightly below that there are video games like Fortnite or Roblox, or 3D environments like <a href="https://arium.xyz">Arium</a> (the pseudo-VR browser-based art gallery platform)</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But “immersion” doesn’t have to mean entering cyberspace. You can get <em>lo-fi immersion</em> if these qualities get across:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">a persistent world – this exists even when you aren’t there.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">place – a sense that I am somewhere other than the chair I’m sitting in right now.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">shared objects – everyone here is seeing and interacting with the same things.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And you know what? You don’t need VR for that. Sure it’s <em>easier</em> with 3D graphics and avatars, but those aren’t essential. You can have persistent worlds with a strong sense of place (and moving between places!) with text-based games (MUDs and MOOs, to go way back) – 2D graphics on the web can work just as well.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Is it multiplayer?</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Today our apps, docs, webpages and computing environments, by default, are personal – the P in the PC. It takes work to make them social. In the metaverse, it’s social by default, and it takes effort to have a non-shared experience.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is something different than the social of “social media,” or the comments and ratings you get with (ugh) UGC, “user generated content.”</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To differentiate from the old social of the existing web, the term of art is <em>multiplayer.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And that connotes liveness. You need a sense of presence. The ability to collaborate on shared objects in the shared world, whether for work or fun. Faces, emotion, video – all of these contribute to a transporting sense that you are surrounded by other people.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes that’s easier with video games and virtual reality. Immersive features such as place and proximity (and distance) make it possible for crowds to co-exist.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But again it can be lo-fi. I was previously tracking <a href="/home/2021/09/27/multiplayer">how the web is going multiplayer</a> and I recently ran across another great example: <a href="https://www.tldraw.com">tldraw</a> is a tiny web-based drawing app. It’s elegant and playful. You scribble on the page, that’s all.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…then look in the menu. There’s an option named <q>Create a Multiplayer Room.</q> Select it. Grab the address from the address bar and share it with a friend. Now you can see each other’s cursors and you’re drawing on the same canvas. No bother no fuss. A little glimpse of the metaverse, right there.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Does it have an economy?</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So we’ve got a shared, persistent world with shared, persistent objects. And it’s multiplayer. The last ingredient is economics.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">By “economics” I don’t just mean buying objects (perhaps digital assets like costumes or upgrades) or even virtual land (such as in <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a>, a land-based economy on the blockchain). What’s important is that these objects are <em>assets.</em> You must be able to sell them; they and their “ownership” must exist in a marketplace that transcends the platform in which they manifest.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So that implies a concept of identity, money, and rights that exists outside any given immersive, social platform or another.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Web3 is one obvious stack for this – or at least the collection of technologies. The stack hasn’t energy yet. By Web3 I mean the crypto <em>(cryptocurrency, rather than cryptography)</em> world of: identity; payments; contracts; ownership; currency; and the entire pile of derivatives that can be created. Yes NFTs are a big part of that. A powerful enabler.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But I don’t see that crypto is intrinsic to having an on-platform economy. It could happen with the dollar (or fiat currency generally).</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the metaverse is a product experience that is immersive and multiplayer with built-in economics.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And a metaverse <em>company</em> is a company that provides that or is somehow part of the stack. Maybe they provide an enabling technology, like easy-to-integrate presence or treasury, or maybe there’s a yet-to-be-identified marketing/distribution mechanism that has a particular requirement on analytics, or maybe they provide an interface like smart glasses. It’s hard to know at this point what the dynamics will be, or where value will be extracted in the value chain.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">The history of the metaverse</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s been a while since I’ve read <em>Snow Crash,</em> Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel in which he invented the concept, so I’ll just grab this from the Wikipedia page on <em>Metaverse</em> instead:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Wikipedia" data-title="Metaverse">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Neal Stephenson’s metaverse appears to its users as an urban environment developed along a 100-meter-wide road, called the Street, which spans the entire 65536 km (216 km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Users of the metaverse access it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from grainy black and white public terminals in booths. The users experience it from a first-person perspective. …</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Within the metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, “to prevent people from walking around a mile high”. Transport within the metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Wikipedia, <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So we’ve already got these three qualities: it’s a persistent world, social, with a built-in economy. It’s dogmatically physical and uses VR, which creates this sense of immersion, which I guess is why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22782860/meta-facebook-reality-labs-soft-robotics-haptic-glove-prototype">Meta nee Facebook is working on haptic gloves</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And the economics is kinda ugly. Ruthlessly commercial, and no room for the open source ethos that was the foundation of Web 2.0, the current generation of the web.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the lineage is clear.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The biggest difference, for me, is that Stephenson’s capital-M Metaverse is singular. There’s one of it. That’s evidently what The Corporation Formerly Known As Facebook imagines too, and they’ll own it. It’s possible that TCFKAF is right, and they’ll be the ones that win big.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The web - or rather the application and protocol <em>WorldWideWeb</em> - was a blip. I think that’s clear now. It was agnostic to document type, happy to link to email, gopher, image, and hypertext. It was frivolously free with assets: when you look at a webpage, the images are downloaded to your computer first and then assembled into a document! You can even <em>“view source”</em> to see the code behind a page. Websites are like applications that wear their source code on the outside.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The web isn’t how systems are typically architected. So we can’t take it for granted that we’ll end up with a small-m metaverse – a distributed network of interconnected metaverses, sharing identity and an economy but otherwise independently immersive. If that’s what we want, we’ll have to work for it.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Web 2.0</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think the last major technology trend like this was probably apps and the smartphone, but actually it’s hard to distinguish that from Web 2.0 that came just before. And it’s interesting to look back at O’Reilly Media’s catalysing 2005 essay: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html">What is Web 2.0</a>: <q>Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What you’ve got in the “meme map” (on page 1 of the five page essay) is an approach is totally born of the new open, networked, social, apps-not-docs web. It’s a set of approaches that <em>implies</em> a set of technologies and commercial models.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Cited are ideas like:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Software that gets better the more people use it</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Services, not packaged software</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Architecture of Participation</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Data as the ‘Intel Inside’</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Granular Accessibility of content</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Play</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And in the years since, we’ve seen these formalised into social media, software as a service (SaaS), tools like git, and ways of working like agile – all applicable to this fast moving, fast growing world. Cloud platforms starting with Amazon Web Services and pioneering tech like Ruby on Rails grew up with Web 2.0. The economics (and economies of scale) of cloud platforms prescribe a cost model for companies, and that prescribes a revenue model: subscription for B2B, and the attention economy to B2C.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Web 2.0 even included its own aesthetic, so participants in the trend could recognise one another versus older, “enemy” approaches like Enterprise. We still have the warm, bold colours, the chatty brands, the rounded-off corners, and the cutesy illustrations of 2005.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Web3 is the re-platforming of Web 2.0 to be crypto-native: new identity, new payments, and new modes of collaboration.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Web3 has its own aesthetic and characteristic visual style. Even its own art movement with NFTs –  <a href="https://outland.art">see the new Outland magazine for art criticism in this domain</a>. And it has its own shibboleth words to identify in-group and out-group. <em>(gm.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>But Web3 isn’t a comparable trend.</strong> It’s the metaverse which rivals Web 2.0. The technology stack, the aesthetics, the community, <em>and the products</em> all grow up together. Web3 is part of the puzzle; the metaverse is the whole shebang.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What happened with Web 2.0 is that it became true but too much.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“Software that gets better the more people use it” is another way of saying that there aren’t any limits on network effects. <em>Platform capitalism</em> (Nick Srnicek’s term, mentioned in <a href="/home/2020/12/11/thingscon">my Thingscon talk last year</a>) is rapacious. We have one Facebook, not ten thousand. Whoops.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“Architecture of Participation” led to the sharing economy… which was co-opted and led to the gig economy, and to so-called “sharing” marketplaces like Airbnb and Uber mining the under-specified edges of the social contract.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The metaverse also contains as-yet unknown failure modes. It would be worth puzzling them out now.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Does the metaverse matter?</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We can decompose the question of whether the metaverse trend matters into two parts:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Is the metaverse significantly different?</strong> Yes: it introduces the concept of scarcity (with space, time, and ownership) into the digital realm, which since its inception has been built on the idea of approx. zero marginal cost of duplicating assets, or communicating with +1 person. Just as Web 2.0 led to new community structures, new business models (and the attention economy), new ways of working, and even new expectations for government (witness GOV.UK in the UK), the metaverse will have its own long-term cultural effects.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Will the metaverse come about?</strong> Well now that’s a matter of opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I will say that the metaverse trend has two qualities in common with two other large scale trends that I saw up close, or maybe let’s call them movements: Web 2.0 (described above) and Tech City, London’s transformation into a global startup hub (I was part of the inception).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Both had multiple constituencies that pushed for the movement for often barely overlapping reasons. With Web 2.0: corporations, individuals, investors, and customers up and down the technology stack. In the case of Tech City: Large corporations and government; founders and real estate owners; lawyers and journalists. Everyone felt they could immediately get more <em>for their particular ship</em> by working to rise this particular tide, and they did this without being instructed what to do.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With the metaverse we have crypto-libertarians tech nerds from Web3 <em>somehow aligned</em> with platform monopolist VR-maximalists from Facebook. Their values couldn’t be more opposed yet they are boosters for the same trend.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When a movement creates alignment without coordination, that’s a powerful force.</p>
