  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I watch a bunch of cricket (and read about it too). I ran across a counterintuitive method which is to <em>not</em> keep your eye on the ball. It turns out this is how elite batters operate, and it has made me think about the way I structure my own work.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Greg Chappell has the idea that there are ascending levels of concentration, with the peak, <em>“fierce focus”,</em> being a state that has a max budget over the day.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Chappell is one of the cricketing greats, a hugely successful Australian batter from the 1970s known for big scores.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">His origin story: he was great <em>sometimes</em> but other times just ok. Then he received a letter that made him think about his game. In a meditative fugue, sitting in the dark: <q>He thinks about every single game of cricket that he has ever played, from his very first in the backyard with his brother Ian … to Test cricket for Australia.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then an epiphany:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Hours later - it is difficult for him to tell how many - he emerges with a stunning realisation: by playing cricket since the age of four, he had, without realising it, developed a systemic process of concentration and a precise method of watching the ball; but he had only been using them consistently on his good days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here is a deep dive into Greg Chappell’s method, and the psychology behind it: <strong><a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1136242/what-does-a-batsman-see">What does a batsman see?</a></strong> <em>(2018)</em> by SB Tang in <em>The Cricket Monthly.</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Brief cricket overview, because I’m a fan and you may not be.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Two teams. One team bats, aiming to hit as many balls as possible and build a big score (runs). The other team bowls, aiming to get batters out (by catching or knocking over the wicket behind the batter). Then the teams switch.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are multiple formats of cricket. One is T20 which lasts 3.5 hours. Each team bowls a fixed number of balls: 120 each. A second format is Test cricket which lasts 5 days. The number of balls is unlimited and the batters stay batting as long as they can. Greg Chappell played Test cricket.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Everything about life can be seen in Test cricket.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Bowlers run up and bowl the ball overarm, with a straight arm, 22 yards from the batter. The ball bounces once, and the goal is to trick the batter so that the ball leaps off their bat in an unintended way so it can be caught, or it sneaks past them and smashes the wicket.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A cricket ball is leather, rock hard and the size of a tennis ball. For Test cricket it is shiny and deep red. It has stitching which stands proud of the ball. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The ball can be bowled at up to 90 mph, and spun up to 2,000 rpm. It swings in the air and changes direction off the ground, both from its own motion, and the position of the seam, and the quality of the ground where it bounces. Its height, when it reaches the batter, is determined by where it bounces. All of which is in control of the bowler.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So batting is hard.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Chappell’s key point: <q>mental energy is a finite resource that a batsman must conserve if he is to achieve his ultimate objective of scoring as many runs as possible, which will require him to spend hours, if not days, out in the middle.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Chappell realised that he had three ascending levels of mental concentration: awareness, fine focus and fierce focus. In order to conserve his finite quantum of mental energy, he would have to use fierce focus as little as possible, so that it was always available when he really needed it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Awareness.</strong> Standing waiting for the ball, Chappell would mark his guard (tap his bat on the ground), look around and count all ten fielders, gaze at the crowd, etc.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Fine focus.</strong> As the bowler ran in, Chappell would maintain <q>his central vision on the bowler’s face and his peripheral vision on the bowler’s body. He believed that a bowler’s facial expression and the bodily movements in his run-up and load-up offered the batsman valuable predictive clues as to what ball would be bowled.</q> He <em>did not</em> keep his eye on the ball.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Fierce focus.</strong> At the bowler’s last stride, he would <q>shift his central vision the short distance from the bowler’s face to the window just above and next to his head from where he would release the ball. Once the ball appeared in that window, Chappell would watch the ball itself for the first time. He could see everything. He could see the seam of the ball and the shiny and rough side of the ball, even when he was facing a genuine fast bowler.</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">After playing the ball, a deliberate step down in focus level: <q>Chappell cycled his concentration back down to its minimum level of awareness.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(This resonates with me because attention is the feeling of our brain allocating scarce realtime processing capacity, and it forms a kind of attentional pyramid, <a href="/home/2021/09/21/playhead">as previously discussed</a>, but I haven’t run across the pyramid being extended and described and <em>used</em> in such a way before.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The rest of the article is <em>incredible,</em> by the way, a real dive into the science and psychology of what’s going on. Read the whole thing.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Don’t watch the ball!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The regular advice in sport is to watch the ball. Greg Chappell says: watch the ball as little as possible. <em>Glance</em> at the ball. Take it in, all at once, only at the microsecond you need to.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I GET THE IMPRESSION, reading about his method, that what he’s doing with all the “awareness” and “fine focus” activities is pre-loading information into his unconscious mind so that, at the critical moment, he can respond automatically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It is not possible to “decide” what to do about a ball coming at you at 90mph. What you can do is make sure your mind is pump-primed with all the available context cues, with the highest signal to noise possible, and then act.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This gives me clues about how to organise my own work?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Not thinking about cricket now.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m building software rn, so I spend most of my time working on product. There’s a lot of sketching, designing, roll-my-sleeves-up building work, and planning.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One way of describing this work is: design and build. But that doesn’t sit right with me. These two activities aren’t sequenced like that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now I can think of my sketching and designs in a different way: I am training my intuition. I am <em>not</em> deciding what to do. I am priming myself such that, when a decision <em>needs</em> to be made (when I’m building or somebody asks me for feedback or when I’m putting together the plan for what to build next), I automatically respond the right way in the instant.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This seems like a small twist in framing but actually I find the difference quite freeing: I can see now that I’m no longer <em>meant</em> to be right with my sketches. I’m not <em>supposed</em> to be straight to the point. What I’m doing is scouting the field; I’m loading up my unconscious with everything it needs to make the right choice later, intuitively.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s not about being logical. It’s not about making a rational decision.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The remaining question is: how to take lessons from Greg Chappell’s central concept of fierce focus. How can I build my working day around a number of critical decision points, exerting my intuition and reflexes intensely and totally for the absolute minimum amount of time, and otherwise not keeping my eye on the ball at all.</p>
