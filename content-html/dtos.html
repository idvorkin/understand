  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">After I posted about <a href="/home/2020/04/22/the_viewing_room">video calls, doing stuff together, and the TV room</a>, there was a great discussion on Twitter. Listen to some of these ideas:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On remote togetherness without having to have anything to say, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1253027420313092096">Tom Critchlow speculates</a>: <q>perhaps an e-ink dithered image that is an always-on video feed of my living room? Shared with family and friends?</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And later in the same conversation, <q>Another way to think about it – always on HD video of the living room shared with family/friends but only at specific times like every day 2-5pm or something.</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…which I’m into as an idea! I like the idea of a scheduled group call that fires up on your TV at 2pm for an hour whether you’re there or not. Also I think there’s a lot to be said for ambient noise – it’d be neat to hear the muffled sound of activity on the other side of the TV screen.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There was a good discussion about how you could do a “keep the doors open” kind of telepresence, but without massive privacy violations. Even a dithered e-ink screen would today require an internet-connected, always-on camera pointing directly into your house. Scary.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://twitter.com/scottjenson/status/1253030571485216768?s=20">Scott Jenson talked about how that could be done:</a> <q>What about local only analysis of an HD signal? The video never leaves the camera, but it does output who it recognizes and that gets shared with only the immediate family.</q> – and I like this idea of compressed <em>“computer vision dithering”</em> that shares only one of those <a href="https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/objectnet3d/">green boxes and labels diagrams</a> rather than the full feed.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How could you guarantee and certify that, <a href="https://twitter.com/gerwitz/status/1253038099338342401?s=20">asks Han Gerwitz.</a>, <q>Maybe we need some sort of visibly low-bandwidth networking. Sensing cameras that output only a QR code display, with scanning cameras collecting from them.</q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I really like the idea of computer networking protocols that are <em>human readable.</em> I have a vague memory of reading about an audible protocol that sounded like birdsong? The advantage being that if a hacker was trying to get into your network, you would hear it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On the other end of things:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Andrew Eland pointed me at <a href="https://tonari.no">Tonari</a> which makes massive room-scale screens that show other, remote rooms, with the people projected there at 1:1 scale: <q>tonari is an open doorway to another place.</q> <em><a href="https://twitter.com/andreweland/status/1253069110386229251">(Here’s Andrew’s tweet.)</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Tonari is for businesses, it’s not made for the domestic context. And I like the idea that sometimes you’re having a meeting, but sometimes you fall into an opportunistic water-cooler chat, and the rest of the time your colleagues are just <em>there,</em> the ebbs and flows of the two offices brought together, however far apart.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I mean…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Some of these ideas are pretty weird. BUT. But. Why not give them a go? The <em>feeling</em> of it all. It would be good.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been trying to put a name to what it is I’m circling, and the best I can I can come up with is this: <strong>domestic telepresence at scale.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">By <strong>telepresence</strong> there’s the usual meaning, being <a href="/home/2011/01/19/telepresence_robots">telepresence robots</a> <em>(which come and go in the zeitgeist, that post is from 2011).</em> But ALSO AND MORE REALISTICALLY I would include group video calls. The robots being something more like “peak” telepresence?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Actually, I would include anything that contributes to this feeling of togetherness… fictional ideas like the idea above of transmitting the ambient noise of the home so I feel like a family member is in an adjacent room, and also real ones like “availability” indicators, and WhatsApp read receipts, and so on.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I’ve learnt from my experiences with casual Zooms with friends, or <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2015/10/08/tomtown">hanging out in social Slacks</a>, or doing workouts with my family in Australia with a combination of YouTube Live and group FaceTimes is that these technologies all combine to produce a sense of togetherness, they all count!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Telepresence isn’t something you step into, rather it’s a gradient. Your attention can be fully or only partially split between the local and the remote. And you’re in multiple groups of course, each of which has different compositions and norms. So you need all these different approaches at different levels for peak telepresence to even have a chance to occur.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then there’s that word <strong>domestic.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can’t even imagine what this lockdown would have been like without the internet. I’m with my family and friends, even though we’re physically sometimes thousands of miles apart. And although I’m giving the internet credit, I will also say that the internet has not really served us that well. The fact that we have this sense of togetherness right now, domestically, is because there is an amazing mass co-opting of technology going on:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Zoom was not made for people to play bridge! Facetime wasn’t created to be left propped up in a corner while we sing “twinkle twinkle little star” and then wander off to make a cup of tea while people come and go from the room. But imagine if these technologies <em>had</em> been built for these behaviours!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Look. People in business will do all kinds of bonkers things if there is Return On Investment.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But “domestic” means having TVs which are shared devices, and phones which are private. It means group accounts. It means old people and young people. It means different rooms in the house. The domestic world is more diverse, more messy, and more demanding. Software isn’t built for this.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What’s particularly energising about this period of <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments">forced experiments</a>, as Benedict Evans calls it, or less abstractly, <em>“not being allowed to see our friends”,</em> is that I’ve been reminded that telepresence is powerful and people want it when it works and there is a absolute TON for us still to explore.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>At scale.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The reason I include <em>“scale”</em> is because I want to figure out how to continue to have this sense of togetherness available for everyone… even after we’re allowed to leave our homes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When the lockdown ends, a lot of this co-opting of technology will end too. That’s a shame.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway, in all of this <em>domestic telepresence</em> I would include</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">door-sized big screens that are telepresence-teleporters into other homes </li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">e-ink portals and low-bandwidth sensors, maybe even our old <a href="http://berglondon.com/projects/availabot/">Availabot</a> presence toy (2006!)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">tabletop robots that can be inhabited by my family members: <a href="https://thecraftyrobot.net/blogs/projects/cheap-telepresence-robot">Ross Atkin’s AMAZING tabletop telepresence device</a> is a DIY robot made from a cardboard kit and a phone, and you drive it around your friend’s kitchen a hundred miles away with your face talking out of it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In what world could <a href="http://goodnightlamp.com">Good Night Lamps</a> be just at home on my shelves as my books are?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Any <em>one</em> of these on their own would be weird. But together, and normalised somehow…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I think what the <strong>“at scale”</strong> requirement makes me ask is: how could these be mainstreamed, and how could people almost compose their own experiences through all kinds of different services and devices, without having to do things like create a new social network in a thousand different places?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t see that the answer could ever be a single service doing it “right”: there can’t be a single “winner” such as Zoom, or Facebook, or WeChat, no matter how many features they throw in. People and groups are too different.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I think of iPhones and Amazon Echoes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">iPhones and Echoes both pass <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/in-silicon-valley-mergers-must-meet-the-toothbrush-test/">Google’s toothbrush test</a>: <q>Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But nobody’s iPhone and nobody’s Echo is the same. We call it “downloading apps” but really what’s happening is that people are making their devices radically different – a camera for one person, a TV for the next. They’re twice-a-day toothbrushes, sure, but it’s a different toothbrush for everyone.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe there’s a lesson here?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I guess what I’m speculating is a kind of social operating system that links all these different parts, and allows new ones to emerge.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Something that doesn’t abstract Zoom, Facebook, and Animal Crossing, but sits alongside them and someone provides visibility between them (or not, as appropriate).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What would it mean to see that your friends are congregating watching Netflix (remotely) while you’re still at work? How could they hassle and yell at you to come hang out already?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A digital photo frame that understands it’s in the shared front room and somehow shares only the pictures appropriate to that context from everyone in the house?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What about something that lets me and my group step up a gear from iMessage not into FaceTime, but into toy telepresence robots, playing an obstacle course that somebody has cobbled together in their front room?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Feeling my way around something here. Not sure what it is yet.</p>
