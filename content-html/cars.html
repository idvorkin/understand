  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s pretty clear that autonomously driving robot cars will be everywhere sooner or later – the question is when.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I had my first ride in a robot cab! I’m in San Francisco this week. And then another experience yesterday, in a different way. Let me tell about them.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Day 1.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">My friend and <a href="http://plasticbag.org/archives/2024/01/how-threads-will-integrate-with-the-fediverse/">social technology expert</a> Tom Coates took me in a Waymo robot cab up to Twin Peaks to see the city.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I mean - beautiful to an absurd degree. Downtown towers lit in the evening sun; a blimp floating over the Golden Gate Bridge; a rainbow joining the peak of the hill parks to the low bruised clouds.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3A8gRGptHQ/">My photos on Insta barely capture it.</a> What you’ll also see there is a video of the steering wheel of the robot car moving on its own, as it drove us down the hill.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It wasn’t a great first ride, on the way up.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We approached a school bus and blocked the road. The Waymo didn’t leave room. While we were waiting, the school bus drive waved at me to get out of the way. I sat in the front passenger seat. I gesticulated at the empty driver’s seat –</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>It’s empty!</em> (I tried to say by waving my arms.) <em>I’m in a haunted car! I can’t tell the ghost what to do!</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It reversed eventually.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Only to get frustrated at a slow cyclist, avoid them by turning left down a street which turned out to be closed to traffic, and then it panicked: the Waymo came to a halt in the middle of the lane, turned on its hazards, and then… nothing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What happened next was reassuring. Tom called customer service and someone took over, turned us round, and we set off again. There were a couple of other erratic moments.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The ride back down from Twin Peaks had no sweaty palm moments at all, so I got to observe.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The dash of the car has a screen with a graphic that shows what the  car can see: it’s a cartoon of the room, coloured blocks being other vehicles, and dots being people.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The way Waymo spots people is not magical. It sees the same people that I do. (So if a person vanished behind something, the dot disappears; no object permanence).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Only it sees much quicker, and all at once. On one particular intersection the car was aware of maybe 20 people. I had to look around to double-check I had seen all the same people.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now, my mental model of attention is a pyramid. The peak is focus; I can focus on one object at once. Below that are things I’m attending to, maybe a half dozen. Below that I have awareness. Objects move up and down the pyramid, deliberately and automatically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Waymo has a broad base of <em>awareness</em> that is bigger than mine. It has more a great attentional bandwidth than humans. This is unusual.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, I had time to have these observations. It felt very quickly very <em>normal</em> to be in this robot car with the empty driver’s seat.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(btw I suspect robot cars will have empty driver’s seats mandated by legislation for a long time; it’s a great visible symbol of the “mind” of the car.)</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Day 2.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">On the following day, a very different interaction with a robot car.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I was driving down the I-280 and had just gotten into enjoying the sun, the scenery and the music. Cruising at 60mph, a (human-driven) car crosses directly in-front of me, swerving across 2 lanes having almost missed their exit, simultaneously slowing to about 20mph.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I hit the brakes hard and luckily there was some distance to the next car behind me: I didn’t hit the erratic driver, and nobody hit me. Phew.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Later I saw a Waymo in one of the middle lanes at 60mph.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t know if it was in autonomous mode, maybe it had a driver taking it back to base.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which car would I prefer to be driving near to on the interstate, the human or the robot?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Well.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can mentally model the robot car way better than other human drivers. I can “contain” my theory of mind of the Waymo.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Waymo is consistent, safe and dumb. Faced with almost missing its exit, the Waymo would re-route. It wouldn’t swerve.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s wild how quickly I went from: oh this will be a white knuckle ride. To: yeah ok, this fits right in, actually I’d prefer to drive near these.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Now the empty driver’s seat is also the removal of somebody’s job. I’m not thinking about that particular social impact here.)</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>What I’ve learnt this week is: it’s clear that this works.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">At some point robot cars will be coming onto our roads as fast as they can manufacture them.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This works, whatever “this” is…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…because what “this” is is not clear. It’s not merely robot cars.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like many things in Silicon Valley, the overall “this” is broad and obscure with scaffolding papered over with money and extraordinary effort. What is real?</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“This” could be robot cars PLUS many, many drivers in offshore call centres with Xbox controllers remotely piloting the car at any semi-tricky point. A wage arbitrage at best; economically unsustainable at worst.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“This” could be robot cars PLUS a required millimetre-precision 3D model of the entire operating environment with wildly detailed statistics about expected environmental behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Whether or not our streets are full of robot cars in, say, 2027, with millions of the things rolling off the production lines depends on which “this” is the reality.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Looking at each…</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Perhaps each robot car rests on the frequent, fractional effort of many, many remote human drivers?</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If there are many drivers, the economics won’t work.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the assumption is that the artificial, artificial intelligence can and will be replaced by actual AI. But can it? Is that moment 2 years away, 5 years away, 10 years away?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Is that moment dependent on collecting sufficient training data, or is it a matter of a fundamental breakthrough in the way AI works?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, in that scenario, we’ll be waiting an unknown amount of time before rollout.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Perhaps the blocker is the ultra high resolution dynamic 3D model of the city?</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Every road, every freeway, every place it might expect to see a person: a map like this is expensive to produce.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So ultimately this requires a financial structuring innovation.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A map is not low-cost, high margin software. Think of it as a large capital investment that requires maintenance, like a developer building a new city quarter. Then it produces a yield as people pay for it over many years.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is not a venture-shaped investment. It’s more like private equity, or infrastructure. Someone will need to product the map and maintain it (like, half a billion dollars globally, say?) then rent it out.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then the yield will need to be repackaged and sold to pension funds who require the rock-steady reliability.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I understand that financial structuring is how EV charging networks rolled out in the Nordics in Europe. This is half-remembered, so apologies, but I believe the breakthrough was to take the company building the EV charging network and de-merge it into two entities.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One, an entity that rents the land and owns the physical infra of the charging points, and buys and sells the electricity. This is a private equity shaped, capital intensive, yield operation.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The second entity owns the customer relationship. It’s mainly software. It innovates on brand, reaches customers with electric vehicles, innovates on pricing and bundles. It’s venture-shaped.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Separated, these two business types can flourish.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In the case of building the 3D operating environment model, it’s like building a chip fab or any other long-lived high-cost asset. The blocker for PE investment is sustainable demand for the map.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So demand can’t just come from Waymo running a taxi operation. There need to be many companies offering differentiated use cases: yes cabs and ride sharing, but also commercial fleets; autonomous driving as a feature in individually owned vehicles; last-mile delivery operations; and so on, all paying per-use.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So that will take a period of time to develop too.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Downstream questions: local legislation, and route to market and supply chain (like, will existing car companies license Waymo’s technology or assemble their own). I feel like the determining points are the ones above.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>My takeaway.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“This” works.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Robot cars work, feel normal, and are even preferable to be in and to be near! There will be very quick cultural acceptance and there’s already cultural readiness. It’s a matter of time. I didn’t take that as a given; that was a surprise to me.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I would <em>love</em> to know what the actual blocker to immediate global rollout is. Those were my guesses.</p>
