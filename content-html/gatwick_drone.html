  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Conjecture:</strong> under great pressure, societies can collectively manifest illusionary objects. These psychic projections, which sometimes appear as terrifying beasts, encode powerful fear or anger or disconnection – and also its resolution.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is a post about the Gatwick Drone, but I’m going to take the scenic route.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Longtime readers will know of my interest in the Monkey Man. Almost a decade ago, the Monkey Man terrorised New Delhi.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s a great summary of the phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://web.archive.org/web/20100208111756/http://graylien.110mb.com/monkeyman.html" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="The Cosmic Jokers" data-title="The New Delhi Money Man">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Early in May 2001, rumours began spreading though New Delhi that an aggressive monkey-like entity was rampaging through the overcrowded suburbs after sunset.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Householders who habitually slept on their flat roofs during the sweltering Indian summer claimed that they were being indiscriminately attacked by the Monkey Man, who leapt from roof to roof, biting and scratching as he went. One man had even fallen to his death fleeing from the creature.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Descriptions of the entity varied considerably, but most witnesses agreed that it was short and furry with glowing red eyes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And a contemporary article communicates some of the terror (16 May, 2001):</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In Noida, a mechanic wearing a black outfit and fitting a description of the Monkey Man was beaten up. A second man was attacked for apparently performing “mystical formulations”.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Some witnesses say the failure to capture the Monkey Man is explained by his ability to make himself invisible.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Deepali Kumari, from Noida, said: “It has three buttons on its chest. One makes it turn into a monkey, the second gives it extra strength, the third makes it invisible.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“He touches a lock and it breaks. But he is afraid of the light.”</p>

<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An Indian psychiatrist has compared the Monkey Man mystery to a penis-related panic among Nigerian men 10 years ago. (20 May)</li>

<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A second reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of India’s Monkey Man. (21 May)</li>

</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Appearance. Chaos and fear and the inability of authorities to do anything about it. The fear is taken seriously and the attacks abate. A tentative speculation about the Monkey Man’s psychological origins; a fierce denial. The phenomenon tails off.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There were people wounded in cases of mistaken identity! There were riots!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what was going on?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I can’t dismiss this as a delusion, or mass hysteria, for three reasons:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">those labels only defer the important questions: why <em>then,</em> why <em>there.</em></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">we deal with many non-actual yet real things in the world: money, status, soap operas, celebrity, sport. I wouldn’t call the Monkey Man any less real than those consensual hallucinations – though perhaps more democratic.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">to pejoratively minimise the lived experience is also a claim that we, the Monkey Man non-believers, inhabit a “truer” world. My claim is that these manifestations are universal (and one of their attributes is we deny their semi-actual status when we’re the ones doing the manifesting).</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For me, the clue is found in these facts: The Monkey Man attacked at night and caused fear; the Monkey Man was scared of water.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100208111756/http://graylien.110mb.com/monkeyman.html">Back to that summary:</a></p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>A rumour spread that the Monkey Man could be destroyed if you doused it in liquid.</q></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Another theory was that residents were so frustrated with the frequent night-time power outages that they were phoning in fake Monkey Man reports, <strong>knowing the authorities would turn the electricity back on before setting out to hunt the beast.</strong></q></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So there we have it – in a period of electricity outages (and, I remember reading, water shortages), and knowing that the Monkey Man would create unrests, communities found a way to force authorities to turn on the lights and prioritise running water. It’s almost like a magic spell.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Does that make the Monkey Man any less real? I don’t think so. Reading the news articles, it seems like many people weren’t in on the joke… especially not the people who got beaten up. <em>(Or maybe a fake “mistaken identity” was a good excuse for something that would have happened anyway…)</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t have my notes to hand, but I seem to remember a similar Goat Man appearing in Mexico City (late 20th century) and, in 19th century London, there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring-heeled_Jack">Spring-heeled Jack</a> who sounds and acts very like the Monkey Man.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I wonder what was the community “purpose” of these collective manifestations? What did the belief in Spring-heeled Jack <em>achieve</em> for Londoners?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I wonder if there are “nodal points” in the group imagination, images that societies will independently alight upon – red eyes, leaping and slashing, etc? Perhaps these memes are shaped to be the most contagious?</li>
</ul>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I was thinking of the Monkey Man when I read this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/01/the-mystery-of-the-gatwick-drone">fantastic long read</a> in <em>The Guardian</em> about the Gatwick drone: <q> A drone sighting caused the airport to close for two days in 2018, but despite a lengthy police investigation, no culprit was ever found. So what exactly did people see in the Sussex sky?</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">115 sightings. 222 witness statements. 1,000 flights cancelled. 140,000 passenger affected, just before Christmas.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">No such drone existed.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/01/the-mystery-of-the-gatwick-drone" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="The Guardian" data-title="The mystery of the Gatwick drone">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Gatwick incident was the first time a major airport was shut down by drones, and it distilled deep cultural anxieties - from the threat of terrorism and unconventional attacks by hostile states, to our fear of new technology. </p>

</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The article cites some other urban legends (the Croydon cat killer is a recent one, local to me), but they aren’t quite the same. The Gatwick drone resulted in something: collective misgivings about flying, airport expansion, vulnerability to terrorism, etc, manifested in a physical drone – <em>which closed down the airport, relieving the fears.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To me this is an infant Monkey Man. Had the drone proven only a touch more effective, let’s say by reducing the number of planes landing into airports where drones were “sighted,” I suspect there would have been many, many Gatwick Drones, all over the world.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Monkey Man and the Gatwick Drone are massively multiplayer Ouija boards.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We all have our fingers on the pointer. Maybe we can feel it pulling towards the letters; maybe we’re doing the pushing. Maybe the messages are deliberate; maybe they’re a form of dowsing the collective unconscious - some kind of Jungian Hadron Collider - or maybe it’s direct from the spirit world. We don’t know and we can’t know, and that’s the point.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The point is that these manifestations sit halfway between fact and fiction. It doesn’t matter who believes and who’s faking it – what matters is that nobody needs to say what the goals are out loud, and yet it is efficacious none-the-less. The power comes back! The planes stop!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And maybe this is a decent way of understanding other collective “hysterias” such as Qanon: not by looking at what they do, that’s not relevant, but by looking at what they force the <em>rest</em> of us to do as an apparent side-effect. How do we bend in response? Now let’s interpret that response, not as a side-effect but as <em>intended.</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One last connection. What I’m talking about are <a href="/home/2020/11/09/haunted_radio">hauntings</a> and my favourite haunting in fiction is in <em>Hamlet.</em> For me, <em>Hamlet</em> is an astounding feat because it is utterly, utterly true to life. Every character, every feeling, every consequence: so believable, so human. Yet it opens with a ghost! The supernatural. One way to understand the ghost is that it is a psychic manifestation of a community under great pressure: everyone at Elsinore knows of the murder of the old King yet, because of the status hierarchy, they are unable to voice the truth to Prince Hamlet. Between the unstoppable force and the immovable object is forged the ghost, a psychic diamond the actualisation of unspeakable need.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(<a href="/home/2015/12/16/hamlet">I’ve posted about Hamlet before.</a>)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway.</p>
