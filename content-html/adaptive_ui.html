  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Software is too complicated. User interfaces have too many commands. Perhaps the answer is an in-app free market economy.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I subscribe to the excellent <a href="https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com">Hardcore Software</a> newsletter which narrates the evolution of the PC and desktop software. It’s by Steven Sinofsky who was at Microsoft from 1989, oversaw development of multiple versions of Microsoft Office as it was created and scaled, and ended up as president of the Windows devision.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With Office 2003, Microsoft was able to see the actual commands used for the first time.</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There were 4,000 commands across all of Office 2003 (Word, Excel, etc)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">80% of users only used two commands: copy and paste</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Nobody used all the features, but everyone used a different set.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/077-what-is-bloat-really" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Hardcore Software" data-title="077. What Is Software Bloat, Really? [paywall]">
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">At a deeper level, most in a company might not use a feature such as Track Changes (or Redlining) in Word. But their lawyer would. And contracts or legal letters might arrive via email for review. <u>Rarely used features became part of the work of others.</u> This network of usage was a key advantage of Office.</p>

<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m into <strong>Adaptive Menus</strong> as an approach.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jensenh/combating-the-perception-of-bloat-why-the-ui-part-3" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Jenson Harris: An Office UI Blog" data-title="Combating the Perception of Bloat (Why the UI, Part 3) (2006)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The first new mechanism, called “Adaptive Menus” or, later, “Personalized Menus” were an attempt to make the top-level menus appear shorter by showing the most popular items first. After a few seconds (or after pushing a chevron at the bottom of the menu) the menu expanded to show the full contents. <u>As you used the menus, items you used often were promoted</u> to the “short” menu and items you never used were demoted to the “long” menu.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s like frequently-used light switches in your house magically getting bigger.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But it didn’t help for Microsoft’s core problem which was <em>discoverability.</em> Users kept on requesting features which were already in the product.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(The eventually solution was to replace menus with visible commands and icons, making it easier to explore: the Ribbon.)</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Kai’s Power Tools,</em> in the mid 1990s, was known for providing awesome Photoshop effects and also for wild experiments with the UI. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html">Here’s a deep dive into the interface of KPT.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Magic lenses! Single-purpose rooms! A dedicated tool <q>meant to create collections of special looking orbs.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Also, <em>“Unfolding Functionality.”</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This deep dive describes this philosophy as fading out commands when not needed.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai%27s_Power_Tools">the KPT Wikipedia page</a> is more specific:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The program interface features a reward-based function in which a bonus function is revealed as the user moves towards more complex aspects of the tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is more how I remember it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I <em>think</em> what would happen is that you would use a particular feature or filter or parameter, and as you used it you would accumulate stars. At a certain number of stars, more advanced features would unlock.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which is another way to deal with clutter, right? It’s progressive disclosure: the user and interface grow in sophistication together.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Neither Office’s Adaptive Menus nor KPT’s Unfolding Functionality is quite right. (Discovering new features is hard. A feature, when you want to go back to it, might be a different place.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT what they both do is they atomise functionality.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Once functions and commands exist as atoms, the user interface can be displayed according to some kind of logic - unfolded with use; reorganised by context, etc.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Feature flags</em> are a super common engineering pattern for turning feature “atoms” on and off dynamically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For example: you have an app with a button that you only want to show to people inside the company, because the feature is still being tested. So you set a flag for that feature for all the users who you want to see the button, and they see it, and for everyone else it’s like the feature isn’t even there.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Unpacking this… <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">Feature Toggles (aka Feature Flags)</a> (Pete Hodgson) gives four categories of feature flags:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Release toggles – allows half-finished code to be shipped so select people can try it out live</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Experiment toggles – features can be activated dynamically for one group or another, to gather data in a A/B test</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ops toggles – allows compute-intense features to be easily deactivated when the service is under load</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Permissioning toggles – premium features are available to the premium group of users; beta features are available only to users who can test the system, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Kai’s Power Tools, through the lens of feature flags, makes up a fifth category: adaptive toggles.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m calling them adaptive in the spirit of the <a href="/home/2020/08/26/adaptive_design">lost Adaptive Design movement</a> from the early 2000s: software is “adaptive” if it is co-created by design and user, and conforms to individual user behaviour.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A sixth category might be <em>pick-your-own toggles:</em> feature flags where the user is in control of what features are off and what features are on.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>BUILD #1: Pick-your-own feature flags</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is 50% of an idea.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Imagine Microsoft Word but it comes as a plain text editor. No bold/italic/etc. The only commands are open, save, copy, and paste.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You get used to it. Then one day you decide you’d like to style some text… or, better, you receive a doc by email that uses big text, small text, bold text, underlined text, the lot.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>What the hey?</em> you say.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a notification at the top of the document. It says: <em>Get the Styles palette to edit styled text here, and create your own doc with styles.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You tap on the notification and it takes you to the Pick-Your-Own Feature Flag Store (name TBC). You pick the “Styles palette” feature and toggle it ON.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So far this is pretty much like the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/browser-flags/">browser flags in Chrome</a> – experimental features in the web browser are hidden behind toggles which are user opt-in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT the difference is that the features aren’t experimental. They are fully-rounded, user-facing, feature “package.”</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the user builds up the capabilities of the app as they go.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The downside? It’s still really hard to <em>discover</em> features. How do you know that text styles (or drawing, or collaboration, or any other feature “package”) is available, unless you go hunting? And why would you go hunting if you don’t already know the feature exists.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s why it’s only half an idea.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>BUILD #2: Multiplayer, purchasable, tradable, giftable feature flags</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The thing is, we’re not in Microsoft Word, we’re in Google Docs – and it’s multiplayer.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been tracking the <a href="/home/2021/09/27/multiplayer">emerging multiplayer web</a> for a while. The fact that our day-to-day work apps, like Slack, Notion, Figma, and Google Docs <em>all</em> have a sense of live presence of colleagues is a big deal. Pretty soon we’ll be able to take it for granted in any app. Presence and collaboration will also be part of any future-VR-based operating system – I’m convinced of that <a href="/home/2022/04/20/vr">after recent VR headset mucking around</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So what if you’re collaborating with your lawyer in Google Docs, and you can see from their avatar that they have the “Track Changes” feature flag activated?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Because you’re in the same doc, you can use it together.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And maybe if you want to use it again, they can just… gift it to you?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Could app feature flags be tradable and giftable? That would answer the discovery problem and the “store” problem.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What we’re talking about is feature flag <em>ownership:</em> a user <em>owns</em> their feature flags, and they carry features with them in a multiplayer space, and can use them together with other people.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which… kinda parallels the physical world, right?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like: if you’re having a workshop in a meeting room, then it’s generally one person who brings the post-its and the pens. It’s part of their job.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It should be the same on a Zoom call. You shouldn’t sit on a call waiting for a host. You should sit on the call waiting for the person who has the screen share feature flag, and the annotate screen feature flag, and so on.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I’m talking about here is a marketplace: maybe a bunch of features in Zoom are free, but you pay $10 for the screen share feature flag, or $100 if you want the “make my webcam look pretty” filter. You can gift it to another user later if you want.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>BUILD #3: ok yeah NFTs</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I continue to keep a close eye on web3, <a href="/home/2022/01/14/stake_patronage">as I said in January</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here and there are glimpses of new ways of storing files, new ways of owning and providing access to data, new ways of asserting identity, new forms of payments …</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I keep a personal running list of what I find interesting in the Web3 gold rush, in the hope of spotting something useful in its fundamentals that has immediate applicability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And maybe here’s one?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">NFTs <em>(non-fungible tokens)</em> are basically database primary keys that can be bought and sold, outside the originating platform.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What’s key about a NFT is that it is <em>owned</em> by a user.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Primary keys can point to anything, and mostly right now they point to jpegs of cartoon apes, pixellated portraits, blobs of text, and some very cool art made by excellent artists (also some terrible art). There are a ton of scams in this space, so you have to squint a little to see through.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There is also an idea called <strong>Functional NFTs</strong> which is when the primary key is meaningful to a particular app or service, and it unlocks feature.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Look, what I’m saying is: why not NFT-backed tradable feature flags?</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">With NFTs you get a whole ecosystem of ownership, marketplaces, dynamic pricing, for-free and for-pay trading, and so on.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If you want to build ownable, tradable feature flags, then it’s actually a relatively sane architecture decision to make use of this chunk of the emerging web3 tech stack to provide it. You might (as the rest of the tech stack comes into play) end up actually having to write <em>less</em> code?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe the ownership experience of NFT-backed feature flags would actually be <em>greater</em> than non-NFT-backed feature flags, and you would be able to charge more? Expensive to provide features (like ones that consume a lot of bandwidth) could even cost more. Applications could end up with a business model that feels more like game DLC?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…but with some fascinating behaviour around users optimising their own apps around different roles (a viewer, a host, a facilitator, an editor, a teacher, etc) to represent the roles they have in their teams, and - in this multiplayer world - mutually learn from one another about how to adapt and co-create their own user interfaces.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">3rd party marketplaces to provide and trade feature flags would arise.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And then there should be some fun features too. It’s not all whiteboards. What would it mean to have a rare and therefore somehow valuable feature flag? What would it feel like to be gifted one?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">For me, this is maybe something to draw out of web3 – either just as inspiration or actually as some real tech.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway. Adaptive user interfaces, avoiding clutter, adding social discovery, NFT-backed feature flags. Apps would start really simple and then grow in complexity around you as you discover features by meeting others. Add in a business model and it sounds like a real-world economy, right? Lots of user experience and design work to figure it out. Can you imagine Microsoft Office 2026 working like this? Something worth sketching I think.</p>
