  <div class="f5 f4-l measure-wide" id="social-select-root" data-highlights>
  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a new project called <em>Color NFTs</em> in which you lay down real cash money to buy and sell colours, and get a cut when that colour is used, so if you owned some specific murky red and the next Rothko appeared and started making electronic art, you would be proverbially quids in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which is ridiculous. But fascinating. But ridiculous. But fascinating.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BECAUSE, well, I have to divert into platform capitalism and meme stocks for a minute.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Okay, we’re used to the idea that engineers at Uber get a stake in the company in return for working there (in the form of stock options). So they share in the upside as the company grows.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(It could be any company but let’s stick with Uber.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then it’s not much of a stretch to say that Uber drivers should <em>also</em> get a stake. They’re practically employees.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then why not also Uber passengers?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Uber follows the principles of Nick Srnicek’s <a href="https://www.ippr.org/juncture-item/the-challenges-of-platform-capitalism">platform capitalism</a>: it gathers data from its captured marketplace, uses that data to drive marketplace activity (by ever-more-efficiently directing drivers and attracting passengers), and uses marketplace growth to capture even more data. It’s an engine.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And what that <em>means</em> is that passengers contribute as much to growth, in their way, as engineers and drivers.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ok, so with every ride and with every referral code shared, a passenger should get a fractional amount of stock in Uber. A share in the upside.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Right!</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe Uber drivers aren’t quite employees, and aren’t quite independent contractors, but they’re a new category of worker <em>(<a href="/home/2021/09/30/jobs">as previously discussed</a>)</em> and they also run their own businesses too. So perhaps that is an equity <em>swap</em> that takes place – the driver ends up with a micro-stake in Uber, but also Uber ends up with a micro-stake in the driver. So there’s a kind of mutualism. Uber ends up being incentivised for the long-term success of its worker community.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And another wrinkle:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s not pleasant to picture <a href="/home/2020/12/04/coops">Uber drivers as being “Below the API”</a>, analogous to commoditised subroutines in the software that runs the app, but it’s a solid way to understand what’s going on.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Lean into that analogy for a second… if Uber drivers deserve ownership-mutualism, and Uber drivers are like software, and Uber itself is <em>built</em> from software - mainly open source software - then surely the open source software used in the Uber app and website <em>also</em> deserves a stake in the company? What does it mean to give startup stock options to a website deployment tool?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And what about the roads on which Uber cars drive? They’re funded by city taxes. Why not pay taxes 99% in cash, and 1% in Uber stock, divided up geographically by mile of road driven?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Why <em>not</em> share in each other’s success?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Keep unfolding this, to more companies and more participants.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I get a picture of a network of mutual dependency – a <em>mutualism graph</em> if you like, just as Facebook is a nodes-and-links graph of people, and the Google index is a graph of webpages.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Mutualism is usually a left-wing idea. What I mean to say is that mutualism also appears from the economic right. There’s a glimpse of it in meme stocks – everything is a meme stock now; <a href="/home/2021/07/21/meme_stocks">the stock market creates cults</a> as stock owners are highly incentivised to indulge in boosterism, whether that’s Tesla or Patagonia.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And just as the wealth of the stock owners is dependent on the success of the company, the company is increasingly dependent on the support (and evangelism) of its stock owners.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Aside from the cult-like incentives, meme stocks are the endpoint of something which has been true for a while about consumerism: as politics gets less able to shape society, votes get devalued. So people have realised that a $1 spent is a vote for the world you want to live in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Automate it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Call it networked value.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Pay $1 for an Uber ride and see that dollar ripple out to the engineers, the drivers, the technology stack, local government… and see the value reflected back in the micro stock option you’re granted, which has dependencies on that whole network too.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Enter: <a href="https://color.museum">Color Museum</a>, the organisation behind Color NFTs.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which launched a few days ago and has been widely mocked online ever since. It has been turning around and around in my head.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You “buy” a colour, for actual money.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And then:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Earn royalties from your colors.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We are building an OpenSea competitor in which transaction fees are shared with Color NFT owners based on the proportional use of their colors in traded NFTs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s unpack that:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An NFT is a way to attach rights, such as ownership, to digital assets. An NFT is like a widely accepted receipt to which you can attach software.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Digital assets such as… art. There are lots of artists making wonderful art, and selling it as NFTs! There are all kinds of vibrant marketplaces! Some arts have gotten pretty rich! Not all.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">OpenSea is one such marketplace, a very big one. The traders are richer than the artists.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But #1: the marketplaces are often full of scams – the people trading the NFTs are quite possibly involved in some kind of baroque pyramid scheme.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But #2: at least the NFTs are backed by beautiful art, right? Not always. Anything can be turned into an NFT, including stuff you completely make up.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the idea of a marketplace to own and trade colours is like buying and selling the ghosts of ghosts.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which is why Color Museum has received the reaction it has.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The idea of Color Museum is that they will provide a platform to trade art, and take a 1.25% fee on each trade, and then split the fee according to the “owners” of the colours on the platform.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s… moderately absurd? Any more absurd than the owners of Sotherby’s getting a share in the profits generated by the take on auctions? Dunno.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What makes it interesting is that it’s an automated way to share value with a network of dependencies. That’s the abstract machine.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(It is interesting to make a habit of trying to see the bad in ostensibly good things (practices we call things like critical thinking and horizon scanning) but also to see the good in ostensibly bad things.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I would be <em>more</em> interested if Color Museum went further:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What if Photoshop, Blender, and so on also existed as NFTs, and they got a cut of the value when art made using their software was sold?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What if the value of a trade cascaded to red, and green, and blue, and Blender, and the sponsors of Blender, and the software libraries Blender depends on, and so on and so forth.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What if, by creating your art with Blender, you got a share in the upside of Blender too, in return?</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">From the perspective of the underlying smart contracts it’s all the same.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Value is networked. And what NFTs do is open up the conversation about how that works.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe we can stop thinking that a transaction is a one-off swap - value in cash one way countered by value in goods the other - and start thinking about a transaction as establishing an ongoing hyperlink of mutualisation, a share for all ships in the upside of the rising tide.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It’s ugly to reduce everything to monetary transactions. But if instead we can see these systems as prototyping the platforms for how to implement mutualism in the real world, and providing us with illustrative examples to discuss it… well.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So Color Museum is simultaneously bullshit and possibly a wild money-grabbing scam but also a tool for mentally exploring the potentialities of networked value, and it can be both at the same time, I’m into that.</p>
