  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s something about art + tech which is niggling at me. The process I’m interested in is when a technology organisation commissions or supports art as a way to understand itself.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t quite understand this itch or why I’ve got it, so I’ve spent a day looking at examples.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as design</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The 1951 Festival of Britain… a celebration of science, culture, and manufacturing. This <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1945to1951/filmpage_fil.htm">public information film</a> introduces it:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Something Britain devised … a milestone between past and future, to enrich and enliven the present. A diverse place, of serious fun, and light-hearted solemnity … That’s us. Or some of us. For we’re more than that… We are the Lion and the Unicorn. The Lion is our strength; the Unicorn our imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1945to1951/popup/transcript/trans_fil.htm">(Transcript)</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As part of this: <q>28 of Britain’s leading manufacturers came together to form the Festival Pattern Group</q> – a collaboration between designers and scientists pioneering the then-new method of x-ray crystallography.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">All catalogued in the Wellcome Trust’s exhibition, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/london/2008/05/07/from-atoms-to-patterns">From Atoms to Patterns.</a> Included were <q>table surfaces, lace, plates, carpets, wallpaper, glass, fabrics, and even ashtrays</q> based on the atomic structures of complex molecules like insulin and haemoglobin.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Another collaboration between design and science:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Mark Champkins who is Inventor in Residence at London’s <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk">Science Museum.</a> His work is sold in the museum shop and includes</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">this bi-metallic lampshade that <a href="http://www.markchampkins.com/portfolio-items/open-up-lamp/">opens up like a flower</a></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">a way to wrap your gifts <a href="http://www.markchampkins.com/portfolio-items/vac-pack-wrapping/">using a vacuum cleaner</a></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="%5Bhttp://www.markchampkins.com/work/">more</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Also this bouquet of flowers for the Queen, <a href="http://www.markchampkins.com/portfolio-items/queen-bouquet/">made out of computer punch cards.</a></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as the cutting edge</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com">Chrome Experiments</a> is <q>a showcase of web experiments written by the creative coding community.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m not sure that Google would call this art, but there are over a <em>thousand</em> purposeless-but-beautiful explorations of what code can do in the browser, and you can bet the Chrome browser team is inspired and stretched by what’s contributed.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One such experiment: <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/ocean-wave-simulation">Ocean Wave Simulation.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Poetic applications of technology…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">These <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPGgl5VH5go">Air Penguins</a> from 2009. Majestic, silver helium-filled robots that swim through the air like penguins through water. Makes me wonder when we’re going to see gentle acrobatic robots over Trafalgar Square, or in stadiums. Soon I hope.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The penguins are by Festo, a German industrial automation company. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FestoHQ">Festo’s YouTube channel.</a> I’m sure the techniques developed (they create these animal-inspired robots every year) will fold back into the day-to-day.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as revelation</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://bostoncyberarts.org/air/fifield_air_essay.html">The Bell Labs artist in residence programme</a> in the sixties:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">VanDerBeek would show up describing phantasmagoric ideas that he wanted the computers to realize and that then Knowlton [the engineer] would patiently explain what the program was actually capable of. Between these poles of reality they produced some of the first computer animation ever. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I look at some of the early <a href="http://lillian.com/films/">films by Lilian Schwartz</a> and I don’t think I’m seeing art as “something to work towards” or even (although it is this too) a kind of buttressing of human <em>meaning</em> to technical work… but as a way of discovering possibility? “Discovering” is too passive a word, the process is two way. The artist reveals and shapes the technology simultaneously.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Schwartz: <q>PIXILLATION occurred at a time when the computer system was linear in time and space; Programs did not yet control pixels as moving, malleable palettes</q> – Pixillation was made in 1970.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Bell Labs in the 1990s, <a href="http://modes.io/listening-post-ten-years-on/">Listening Post:</a></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">viewers are immersed in a sonification and visualization of thousands of simultaneous conversations happening on the internet at that moment in real-time. An arched wall of hundreds of small screens display ever-changing text in a cool glowing blue. Electronically-generated voices in both a pitched-monotone and natural-inflection sing out the text from every corner of the room singly, overlapping, or in strange harmonies.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The Xerox PARC artist in residence programme is <a href="http://www.tml.tkk.fi/Studies/Tik-111.080/2000/papers/giulio/art_xerox.pdf">described here.</a> I’m entranced by the work of <a href="http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/">Judy Malloy</a> who in 1993 created a smart kitchen (an Internet of Things kitchen, a cybernetic kitchen, a ubiquitous computing kitchen…) as a multi-player text adventure. <a href="http://www.well.com/user/jmalloy/narrative_moo.html">Her description:</a></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">the devices were a mobile, audio equipped robot, (Ralph Will Clean Up After You) a database food dispensing table, (GoodFood), a pre-narrative video device, (Barbie-Q) and two electronic books. (Sarah’s Diary and the narranoter) The social nature of LambdaMoo was also incorporated into Brown House Kitchen. Players could sit at the table, order meals, and as is usual in LambdaMOO, talk with other players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And there are <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X9RcqUlfM70C&amp;pg=PT129&amp;lpg=PT129&amp;dq=1993+brown+house+kitchen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iSFT7JlEnA&amp;sig=v5-q6wtBntwceAWCbbkDn88KP70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIz-%5C_S7qG9yAIVSygeCh1y5gFf#v=onepage&amp;q=1993%20brown%20house%20kitchen&amp;f=false">extracts from Brown House Kitchen here:</a></p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">look ralph</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ralph is an aging Will Clean Up After You Unit, manufactured in 2003 by Orlando Kitchen Thingmans. His straight white hair is combed back from his pink, wrinkled simulated skin. When you talk to him, it becomes apparent that his gossip player is stuck in some previous month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What strikes me about this vision of the future is that, unlike <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/11/kitchen-computer/">other future kitchens,</a> it feels fully realised. This is a world we might live in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the point of Malloy’s work isn’t to be a vision of the future: It’s (in her words) <q>narrative performance art</q> which is a harder to grasp and much more interesting place to be.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are other residencies:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/04/06/397823309/artists-in-residence-give-high-tech-projects-a-human-touch">NPR discusses the programmes</a> at Autodesk and Facebook. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3043276/my-creative-life/welcome-to-the-brave-new-world-of-the-corporate-sponsored-artist">The residency run by Amtrak</a> is intriguing: <q>It was about looking outward, but from what I hear from other Amtrak writers, many used it as an opportunity to look inward.</q></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as irritant</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://www.readingart.ca/blog/?p=1432">John Chamberlain’s residency at the RAND Corporation</a> (published in 1971).</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Chamberlain distributed a cryptic memo to all consultants at RAND … ‘I’m searching for ANSWERS. Not questions! If you have any, will you please filll in below, and send them to me in Room 1138.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Some responses:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>Quit Wasting RAND Paper and Time.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>GO TO HELL MISTER!!</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q>An artist in residence is a waste of money.</q></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as marketing</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve run across lots of instances of artists being commissioned for marketing – to get the word out but in a classy way. And of sponsorship of galleries and art prizes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You know, <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/warhol-the-computer/">Andy Warhol drawing Debbie Harry as part of the launch of the Amiga 1000.</a> You can’t get any <em>more</em> art.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But it’s not the itch I’m feeling.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When the art is outward-facing, as marketing, as communication that runs at the launch of a product and includes no feedback loop into the product’s invention… when this happens, the tech company isn’t using the art to talk to itself, to understand itself.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That said, you do get instances where it all comes together, technology and art and adverting and reflection: <a href="http://www.anothersciencefiction.com">Another Science Fiction: Advertising the Space Race 1957-1962</a> by Megan Prelinger.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Prelinger documents how the tech companies involved in the space race would use science fiction artists to create their adverts, briefing them on their top secret research to make nod-and-wink messages to other companies, and also - because the artists would feed ideas to sci-fi authors - subtly influencing the emerging <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2015/02/02/consensus_cosmogony">consensus cosmogony.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2009/11/26/another-science-fiction/">More here.</a></p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as adjacency</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I find it hard to figure out the relationship between Rackspace (a hosting company) and <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/blog/2013/02/20/the-rackspace-book/">gapingvoid, an artist and now a consultancy.</a> Is it patronage and a kind of “corporate social responsibility,” or access to a fresh well of ideas, or an association – a kind of cultural osmosis that Rackspace believes it needs? </p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as decoration</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Graffiti artist David Choe accepted equity instead of cash to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/graffiti-artist-painted-facebooks-first-office-now-worth-200-million-2015-6">paint Facebook’s offices in 2005.</a> Choe’s stock is now worth $200 million.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as curation</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Sometimes art is about curation, an intervention that creates maybe a binding gravity, or maybe a sense of history or manifest destiny, or maybe a landscape that produces a new language from the spaces opened up between things.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">My examples here aren’t always from technology companies, but I find them all inspirational none-the-less.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s <a href="http://cyberneticserendipity.net">an unofficial archive</a> and a short video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8TJx8n9UsA">Reichardt opening the exhibition.</a></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And of course: <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2015/07/06/filtered">Modern art was a CIA weapon,</a> funded and nurtured to battle in the cultural front of the Cold War.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as content</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.electricobjects.com">EO1 by Electric Objects</a> – a screen that leans against your wall and displays art.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Only… this is a TV that sits on its side emitting light. It doesn’t make sense to reproduce oil paintings on it. That’s not art, that’s a screen saver.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I like is that EO1 <a href="https://zine.electricobjects.com/artist-program">launched with an artist programme:</a></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Artworks can take the form of still images, animated gifs, video, generative and web-based works …</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Selected artists will be featured and promoted in Art Club, Electric Objects’s collection of new and original art for EO1, and receive an EO1 prototype plus a $500 commission fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Art as a way to explore the form. In a way, like when <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/04/17/ev-williams-medium-acquires-long-form-journalism-site-matter/">Medium acquired Matter</a> – long-form content presentation tool acquires long-form journalism organisation.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Art as reflection</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://brendandawes.com/projects/sixmonkeys">Six Monkeys</a> by Brendan Dawes with newsletter-sending-technology-company Mailchimp. From the intro:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Email is often thought of with negative connotations; overflowing inboxes, strategies on how to get to inbox zero … There is however another side. Email is a ubiquitous, easy to understand system, working across any platform that can deliver not just the unwanted and the unloved but often the exact opposite; messages from friends, exciting opportunities, memories of trips taken and a million other things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What is it?</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Six Monkeys is a series of six connected objects that look at how we might change our relationship to email by changing the surrounding context of how we interact with it. By placing email within our everyday physical spaces it may get us to look at the familiarity of email in a new light; we may even learn to love it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Is this marketing? Well <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3036508/these-six-monkeys-will-totally-change-the-way-you-look-at-email">Mailchimp got press in the right places.</a> But I think the key is in the phrase, <q>email in a new light.</q> My feeling is that Six Monkeys speaks best and loudest to Mailchimp and its community of users, keeping them alive to what email really is, not just what it is today.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Also this: <q>Each object is named after a famous Chimpanzee used in linguistic research.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Another stand-out:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The <a href="http://theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a> (co-founded by Tim Berners-Lee, led by Gavin Starks) trains companies and lobbies for open data. But since it formed in 2012, it has also commissioned and exhibited art.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The <a href="https://theodi.org/culture">ODI’s Data as Culture programme:</a></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Artworks have included a knitted data discrepancy, a larger-than-life sized electronic sculpture, a semi-sentient vending machine, data collection performances, kinetic objects, and pneumatic machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="http://theodi.org/culture/collection">Explore some of the collection here</a> but I know there’s more – I’m seeing if I can lay my hands on the catalogues, or find out whether there’s an online gallery.</p>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Final thoughts</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So I’m not super drawn to art-as-marketing, or even technology-as-artistic-tool – what’s grabbing me is when art is used in some kind of process by a company or organisation to think about itself. Either by commissioning, or via a residency programme, or as some kind of poetic effort or exploration. But not as design, really, or simple patronage. Something else.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_(art_collective)">net.art</a> is brilliant and exciting - a number of artists fizzing as they explore and define a medium - and also <a href="http://www.paolocirio.net/work/gwei/">art as outsider critique</a> (2005), what’s intriguing to me is the <em>deliberate</em> use of art, by the tech organisation <em>itself,</em> for… something. Whatever it is. If it even knows.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">An instinctive urge for interpretation?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Connection?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Here’s a report on <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/july-2013/cern-artist-in-residence-develops-ear-for-physics">sound artist Bill Fortana at CERN,</a> home of the Large Hadron Collider:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Fontana recorded the sounds. The popping, tapping dance beat of the protons’ regular release is underlaid with the hiss of cooling water and the heavy clang of the magnets charging and discharging. …</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">[Fontana] listened to the proton source for a moment, and then handed his headphones to Detlef Kuchler, the physicist who prepares the protons and launches them on their journey. …</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">“The picture on Detlef’s face was astounding,” [Koek] says. “This was his baby – and it looked as if he had just heard it crying for the first time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Thanks</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The reason I’m looking into this is a short (and visual) report I’m writing – I lend a hand at a Large Technology Company You’ve Probably Heard Of, and my hunch is there’s some important stuff here. I’d like to understand it better and to bring to their attention.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">While I’m not writing up my conclusions here, I’ve posted the research because most of these projects were shared with me on Twitter and in follow-up emails by a ton of people.
