  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How will we collaborate with AI? Let me try for a quick typology because I want to zoom in on a particular model…</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Programmatic</strong> – we use AI behind the scenes to automate work at an intern level of complexity (this is <a href="/home/2023/02/07/braggoscope">how I built Braggoscope</a>)</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Interactive</strong> – the AI becomes part of the user interface… somehow.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Some examples of interactive AI:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Direct chat</strong> – like ChatGPT, we’re all pretty familiar with that. As an extension, the chat agent might be able to use some tools, for example browsing and summarising the web. It’s flexible! But there are disadvantages: it’s very unclear, at any given moment, what the AI is able to <em>do</em> for you.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Supercharged software features</strong> – think about Adobe filters that magically extend a background, or GitHub Copilot magically auto-suggesting the next 20 lines of your code.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Command prompting</strong> – you choose a menu command like <em>“generate”</em> and add a prompt to refine the request: <em>“a function that fetches… [etc]”.</em> Two sophisticated exemplars: <a href="https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter">Replit Ghostwriter</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">Notion AI</a></li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Clippy</strong> – a personal AI assistant that lives at your elbow, can use anything you can see, and has the keys to your docs and knowledge. It’s where Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23732454/microsoft-ai-windows-11-copilot-build">Windows Assistant</a> is headed. Maybe it looks like a chat down the side of your screen; there’s one of it.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Teammate</strong> – in a multi-user setting, like Google Docs, or Figma, or (in a non-realtime context) perhaps one day competing for Replit Bounties, a role usually taken on by a human teammate is taken by an AI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m sure there are more! That’s to give a sense of the breadth.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway, recently I’ve been focusing in on <strong>AI-as-teammate</strong> because, for me, that’s where the action is.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Why</em> AI-as-teammate?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The pragmatic answer: if we’re asking how to collaborate with AI in software, then first let’s look at the history of collaborative software generally, which is long and rich, and treat AI as a special case of that. Why re-invent the wheel?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve written before about how this could look:</p>
<blockquote cite="/home/2022/10/26/teammates" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Interconnected" data-title="Let me recruit AI teammates into Figma  (2022)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A writer will work in a Google Doc alongside an AI editor making suggestions, and an AI fact checker and researcher doing the running, and an AI sub doing the wordsmithing.</p>
<footer class="measure f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">– Interconnected, <cite><a href="/home/2022/10/26/teammates">Let me recruit AI teammates into Figma  (2022)</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">When you get into the details, it turns out that the questions you ask about how to build the interface are the questions you would ask about <em>any</em> multiplayer/collaborative interface:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">how do you show that another user/AI is busy on a particular sentence, or block, or text box? What’s the visual indication that part of the app is <em>“locked”</em> – or how do you merge conflicting changes?</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">how do users/AIs recognise one another such that you know that, say, your editor is around to help? With regular UI we would call this <em>affordances:</em> how a tool advertises what you can <em>do</em> with it. ChatGPT is terrible at affordances; skeuomorphic iPhones circa 2009 were great. The “affordance” of colleagues is that (a) we know each other, and (b) the facepile in the corner of the screen gives us presence.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">how do you <em>summon</em> help? What is the <em>sideband</em> of the current working document where you plan what you’re going to do? e.g. in Google Docs, you @-mention someone in a comment.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">how do you <em>receive help which is offered?</em> Again in Google Docs, human users can make use of track changes – but let’s say you have an AI fact-checker or style-helper, do you really want them jumping in all the time? Even when you’re in drafting mode? So how does that interaction work?</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">In a team context, <strong>human/AI collaboration is a degenerate case of multiplayer collaboration generally.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which is why I get so into investigating multiplayer interactions, and <a href="/home/2022/11/09/map">I’ve written a lot about it</a>: I feel like it’s a pre-requisite for really good AI interfaces.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">BUT… realtime, multiplayer apps aren’t that common. I mean, increasingly they are, but not until recently.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One of the reasons for that is that (historically) building realtime, multiplayer apps has been a hard engineering problem. It still it, mostly. So there’s been less experimentation and exploration than there might have been.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So that sets the scene.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>tl;dr let’s investigate AI-as-teammate in the context of realtime, multiplayer apps, and see what we learn.</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which brings me to PartyKit.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m halfway through my <strong>inventor in residence</strong> project with PartyKit, <a href="/home/2023/07/18/work">which I talked about here</a> (at the same time as announcing my micro product invention studio, <em>Acts Not Facts).</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What I’ve been doing:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Learning and sketching.</strong> <a href="https://partykit.io">PartyKit</a> solves realtime multiplayer. So I’ve been learning my way around it by making small multiplayer software sketches.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Building my first multiplayer NPC teammates</strong> (not entirely AI yet, as you’ll see) – and I have some lessons.</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">(NPC = <em>non-player character,</em> which is a term from the video-game world. Think: fake user.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s hit those in turn.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Month 1: Learning and sketching</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I gave myself a month just to build toys and learn my waty around.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">PartyKit is pretty low-level internet infrastructure.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Like, if you want to have live, multiplayer cursors whizzing around on your webpage, what you do is you write some code that sends the position of your cursor to the backend party-server. Then you write a party-server that basically has one rule, which states: when you get an updated cursor position, broadcast it to all the other web browsers who are connected to this page.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Then the party-server just… runs… forever. It just spins along in the cloud.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I am simply not used to realtime, multiplayer wiring being simple and reliable. I wasn’t expecting it to be so simple I could write it myself. The abstraction level is perfect.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And then you make it as complicated as your imagination allows.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So it feels like being given a new primitive for the internet. Would new things could you build when relational databases came along? Or location-aware devices? It’s on that order of novel capability.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="/more/2023/partykit/sketchbook.html">Here’s my month 1 PartyKit sketchbook.</a></strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There are 5 examples there, with short write-ups, and all the code is open on GitHub so you can see for yourself how to write these party-servers.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(There’s a pretty multiplayer Voronoi diagram cursor toy, which can now also be found on the PartyKit homepage, an evolving tiny garden, and a collection of drop-in web components to bring ambient presence to any website.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I’m not going dig into those examples right here, except to say that it was <em>imagination expanding,</em> right?, to give myself a month to get familiar with the material and internalise the possibilities that I didn’t realise were there on day 1.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">Month 2: NPCs and, uh, helpful dolphins</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You don’t get as <em>far</em> when you make working code vs drawing and writing. That’s true.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">AI-as-teammate, in my imagination, is powerful and elegant and fully-integrated and bejewelled with clever design detailing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But the devil is in the details. “Making” is less ambitious and less imaginative, compared with sitting down with your pens, but what I find is that I confront the reality of the material in unexpected ways - no matter how crude my prototype - and that slingshots me off into brand new directions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Let me give you an example.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwp4Sg8NhnE/">Here’s my initial sketch of a dolphin cursor on a webpage.</a> <em>(I posted it on Instagram.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What you’ll see there is simple pen and ink: there’s a dolphin cursor that lives in a little circle, then the user asks it do something (by “chatting” with it, somehow?). Then the cursor emerges from its home, writes a poem on the webpage, and returns home again.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And THEN I went round the houses trying to build just that. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’ve been building using <a href="https://www.tldraw.com">tldraw</a> which is a really good multiplayer whiteboard in a webpage. It’s low fidelity which stops you getting lost in the weeds. (I do all my design work in tldraw, Keynote, or code.) They offer an open source version you can integrate into your own apps.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But, when I’m running this whiteboard, should my NPC virtual user run its code inside my web browser? Or run its own web browser in the cloud? Or connect to the tldraw back-end server itself and attempt to manipulate the document state? Or…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Architecturally this is interesting. Because if we are going to have AIs living inside our apps in the future, <strong>apps will need to offer a realtime NPC API for AIs to join and collaborate</strong> – and that will look very unlike <em>today’s</em> app APIs. And how will we get the visual training data for AI models to connect together what the user is seeing and the machine API? Questions for the future.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Anyway: I want to show you where I ended up.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong><a href="/more/2023/partykit/npcs.html">Here’s my dolphin NPC PartyKit sketchbook.</a></strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I posted this just today.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You’ll see three GIFs:</p>
<ol class="list ph0 ph0-ns numbered-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">You create a “pool” or a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cursor-park">cursor park</a> (<q>a space on a Google Docs page designated for placing your mouse cursor when you’re not actively editing the document</q>) or (as I call it) an <strong>embassy</strong> on the whiteboard. The NPCs need somewhere to hang out when they’re idle. Then you <strong>summon</strong> your NPCs from the comms walkie-talkie on the page.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>NPCs can accept commands!</strong> From your walkie-talkie, you can tell the poet NPC to venture out of its embassy to write a poem. So it does that, as you can see, leaving a haiku on the whiteboard, then returns home.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>NPCs can be proactive!</strong> The painter dolphin likes to colour in stars. When you draw a star, the painter cursor ventures out of the embassy and comes and hovers nearby… <em>“oh I can help”</em> it says. It’s ignorable (unlike a notification), so you can ignore it or you can accept its assistance. At which point it colours the star pink for you, then goes back to base till next time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Check out the movies on that page. It’s all working code! I can interact with these dolphin-cursor-NPCs. Let me tell you, it is uncanny to see a machine-driven cursor. It doesn’t move right. </p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Look <strong>yes</strong> it’s ridiculous, and these are woefully simple, toy interactions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But, but, <em><strong>and</strong>,</em> I learnt a ton.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>ASIDE: first, a note about dolphins.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If we’re going to be living and working alongside AIs, then what’s our theory of mind for them?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">They can speak our language and seemingly understand us too, better than my smartphone can. (My smartphone understands me jabbing with one finger and that’s about the limit of it.)</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And it is <em>handy,</em> when interacting with AIs, to ascribe it some kind of personhood. There’s a folk psychology skeuomorphism going on there which is useful: it means we can map person-like qualities of intent, knowledge, personality, expertise, and foibles onto these AIs, instead of having to find other ways to communicate that in other ways in the UI.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But AIs are distinctly not human. Like us, but not like us.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Nonhuman species are a useful metaphor, right? Dolphins are my go-to companion species - human-equivalent smarts but utterly alien in terms of the chasm between us.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There’s a whole history of human/dolphin interaction to draw on <em>(<a href="/home/tagged/dolphins">explore my posts tagged ‘dolphin’</a>)</em> but I want to highlight some work from 1974 by the architects <em>Ant Farm,</em> when they designed the Dolphin Embassy.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><a href="/home/2022/07/12/folktale">I have a couple links in this post:</a></p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One blueprint shows the deck of a raft on which humans have their media pod, galley, command station and so on, and in the centre is a circular pool, with steps going down to it, and the pool is open to the depths, meaning that dolphins can swim up and appear inside it. So <u>while the human raft sits on and is contained by the ocean, the pool is contained by the raft, and there’s an elegant symmetry to that, a place for a meeting of peers.</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">That’s why, in my prototype, the dolphin pool is a triangle with a circle in it, it’s a schematic of that work by Ant Farm. Now you know.</p>

<h3 class="measure f4 f3-l lh-copy black-80 pt3 pt4-l pb0 mb0">What I learnt from my dolphin NPCs</h3>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Cursors are a great way to communicate attention.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We’ve got this problem with AI-as-chat and AI-as-superpowered-menu-command that there’s no way to <em>discover</em> what the AI might do for me.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Sit someone down with ChatGPT, even, and they’ll barely scratch the surface of what’s possible.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, instead, perhaps the user can go about their regular work, and the AI can pipe up when it spots an opportunity to be helpful?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Now that’s tricky because how can the AI be certain that it would be useful? Or maybe the user would change what they were doing if they knew, ahead of time, that the AI would offer help.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Cursor distance = confidence. When an NPC wants to be proactive, it can hover nearby. It can be pushy when it <em>knows</em> it can help. (It can remember not to pipe up again if it is banished.) There’s a lot of resolution to explore here.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Visual interfaces need a ‘suggestion language’ which is as good as ghosted text is for autocomplete.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As handy as cursor distance is, it falls down when it gets to the specifics. The <em>ghosted text</em> interface you get with suggested autocomplete in GitHub Copilot is sublime. We’re going to need something just as deft when it comes to an AI suggesting that it could (for example) automate hunting for an Airbnb for you.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>An NPC side-channel is necessary - you can’t do it all with cursors.</strong></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">As independent and autonomous as my multiplayer dolphin cursors are, I initially expected I would be able to craft the entire interaction via cursor chat. Not the case.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Instead I feel like I’m coming back to chat. Now, I’ve been pretty negative on the whole chat-sidebar thing as a UI element. It seemed dumb to me to have a great big chat interface down the side of your app, just to talk to your AI agent. Interact more directly, right?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But this dolphin comms/walkie-talkie block (that you can see in my NPC GIFs) is taking me back to chat. Or rather, a form of chat which is where I chat with my human collaborators, but also where my dolphin NPCs can offer more fine-grained interactions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m thinking I need an OS-wide chat channel that NPCs jump into as I move from app to app.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">ANYWAY: this is getting a little abstract.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Ok, two more quick points:</p>
<ul class="list ph0 ph0-ns bulleted-list">
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>Multiple NPCs make a ton of sense.</strong> I was unsure whether this would work, but <em>of course</em> you need a different collection of NPCs at different times, just as you work with different colleagues over the duration of a project. It is so much simpler to see <em>“poet”</em> and <em>“painter”</em> dolphins than a single NPC and wonder about the boundaries of its capabilities.</li>
<li class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>There is so much character in cursor motion.</strong> I initially had the machine-controlled cursors travelling linearly across the canvas, and it felt so creepy. Now the cursors rubber-band their way to their destination, the velocity being proportion to the distance remaining, just as <em>we</em> do, with our cursors. And I’m looking forward to seeing what can be communicated as they tentatively move closer, or back off, or tremble like a racehorse in the starting block, or idly meander. So rich.</li>
</ul>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One thing that strikes me as funny as that cursors are so incredibly useful to share a locus of attention, and I’m adopting them just as they’re about to vanish entirely in the computing landscape – there are no cursors on smartphones, or in Vision Pro augmented reality.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So maybe the future of cursors is this kind of vestigal icon showing attention and presence, abandoned by humans, but a regular device for our nonhuman AI brethren.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m going to continue to dig into NPCs for a couple weeks. I’ve got some good foundations now to prototype with infinite canvases (with tldraw) and autonomous NPCs (using PartyKit), and there’s a lot to figure out in terms of interaction patterns and also in terms of future software architecture.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’d love to see what you’re building, if you’re digging in this space too.</p>
