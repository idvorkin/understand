  <p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>June 2022.</strong> Blake Lemoine, an engineer at Google, claims that their new AI is sentient <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/22/23274958/google-ai-engineer-blake-lemoine-chatbot-lamda-2-sentience">and is fired</a> <em>(The Verge).</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>Although, not quite. You can piece what actually happened from Lemoine’s own <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/may-be-fired-soon-for-doing-ai-ethics-work-802d8c474e66">contemporary Medium article</a> and the subsequent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/">Washington Post piece</a> [<a href="https://archive.ph/20o90">no paywall</a>]: Lemoine shared a doc around Google titled “Is LaMDA Sentient?” (LaMDA is the name of the AI, a large language model like GPT-3) – a colleague said this was <q>a bit provocative.</q> He started to speak with people outside the company and was placed on disciplinary leave for violating confidentiality. Lemoine upped the ante, <q>inviting a lawyer to represent LaMDA,</q> and then you’re kinda done I reckon. But the point is that the question was asked.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Can an AI be sentient?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Are there already sentient AIs, and if not now then when? 1,000 years from now? Surely. 100 years? Probably. So 10 years? Maybe. How about 2025? Tomorrow?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">How could we tell?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Would it matter?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’m going to muddle sentience and consciousness here because I don’t want to get lost in definitions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Wikipedia’s article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">Sentience</a> cites philosopher Antonio Damasio and says that <q>sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness</q> and limits it to <q>the capacity to feel sensations and emotions.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">According to this view: consciousness = sentience + creativity + intelligence + sapience + self-awareness + intentionality + more.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I’d prefer to say that our terms are ill-defined, and that consciousnesses may have all kinds of different characteristics, and may be a matter of degree.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So let’s enlarge the question, and agree to come back to pinning down terms later: can an AI be conscious?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>2017.</strong> Philosopher Susan Schneider proposes ACT: the AI Consciousness Test.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The idea is that consciousness is something that is felt: <q>we can all experience what it feels like, from the inside, to exist.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So the question for ACT is <q>whether the synthetic minds we create have an experience-based understanding of the way it feels, from the inside, to be conscious.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">i.e. do AIs feel the same as we do?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The proposed test is a series of questions.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/is-anyone-home-a-way-to-find-out-if-ai-has-become-self-aware/" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Scientific American" data-title="Is Anyone Home? A Way to Find Out If AI Has Become Self-Aware (2017)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Thus, the ACT would challenge an AI with a series of increasingly demanding natural language interactions to see how <em>quickly</em> and <em>readily</em> it can grasp and use concepts and scenarios based on the internal experiences we associate with consciousness. At the most elementary level we might simply ask the machine if it conceives of itself as anything other than its physical self. At a more advanced level, we might see how it deals with ideas and scenarios such as those mentioned in the previous paragraph. At an advanced level, its ability to reason about and discuss philosophical questions such as “the hard problem of consciousness” would be evaluated. At the most demanding level, we might see if the machine invents and uses such a consciousness-based concept on its own, without relying on human ideas and inputs.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Article by Susan Schneider and Edwin Turner.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One problem - as with GPT-3/ChatGPT - is that large language models are extraordinary mimics. So maybe they just <em>say</em> the right stuff to pass the test.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Schneider’s suggestion is to “box in” the AI away from human culture until we’ve tested it against the ACT, so it can’t make guesses.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">I don’t know. I’m more convinced by the <em>“quickly and readily”</em> component of ACT. Surely there are some puzzles that are quicker to deduce if you have self-awareness? Dunno.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The AI Consciousness Test is one in a long line of tests for machine intelligence, such as the Turing Test.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><strong>2020.</strong> There’s a solid critique of ACT in this paper by David Udell and Eric Schwitzgebel, <a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SchneiderCrit.htm">Susan Schneider’s Proposed Tests for AI Consciousness: Promising but Flawed</a> (PDF at that link).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The challenge is that there’s always going to be a lower-level explanation of how the AI is answering questions on the silicon substrate (a giant lookup table, matrix maths, whatever), and that no series of questions is going to be sufficient to convince people that there is genuine machine consciousness at a higher level too.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">One for the philosophers.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But Udell &amp; Schitzgebel are articulate on the <em>urgency</em> of finessing ACT or something ACT-like:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/SchneiderCrit-200828.pdf" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="David Billy Udell and Eric Schwitzgebel" data-title="Susan Schneider's Proposed Tests for AI Consciousness: Promising but Flawed (2020)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">AI consciousness, despite its present science-fictional air, may soon become an urgent practical issue. Within the next few decades, engineers might develop AI systems that some people, rightly or wrongly, claim have conscious experiences like ours. <u>We will then face the question of whether such AI systems would deserve moral consideration akin to that we give to people.</u> There is already an emerging ‘robot rights’ movement which would surely be energized by plausible claims of robot consciousness (Schwitzgebel and Garza 2015; Gunkel 2018; Ziesche and Yampolskiy 2019). So we need to think seriously in advance about how to test for consciousness among apparently conscious machines …</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Schneider, in her <em>Scientific American</em> piece above, broadens the urgency to brain implants:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">machine consciousness could impact the viability of brain-implant technologies, like those to be developed by Elon Musk’s new company, Neuralink. If AI cannot be conscious, then the parts of the brain responsible for consciousness could not be replaced with chips without causing a loss of consciousness. And, in a similar vein, a person couldn’t upload their brain to a computer to avoid death because that upload wouldn’t be a conscious being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Consciousness is hard hey.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Consciousness is <em>weird.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Let’s say that we agree that a silicon substrate can host consciousness.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or that a group of organic cells, properly arranged etc, can host consciousness.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">There is a slippery slope…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Eric Schwitzgebel again:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><q><u>The United States is literally, like you, phenomenally conscious.</u> That is, the United States literally possesses a stream of experiences over and above the experiences of its members considered individually.</q></p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/Weirdness-211026.pdf" class="quoteback bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i" data-author="Eric Schwitzgebel" data-title="The Weirdness of the World (2021)">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If you’re a materialist, you probably think that rabbits have conscious experiences. And you ought to think that. After all, rabbits are a lot like us, biologically and neurophysiologically.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If you’re a materialist, you probably also think that conscious experience would be present in a wide range of naturally evolved alien beings behaviorally very similar to us even if they are physiologically very different. And you ought to think that. After all, it would be insupportable Earthly chauvinism to deny consciousness to alien species behaviorally very similar to us, even if they are physiologically different.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But, I will argue, a materialist who accepts consciousness in hypothetical weirdly formed aliens ought also to accept consciousness in spatially distributed group entities. If you then also accept rabbit consciousness, you ought also accept the possibility of consciousness in rather dumb group entities.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Finally, the United States is a rather dumb group entity of the relevant sort (or maybe even it’s rather smart, but that’s more than I need for my argument).</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If we set aside our prejudices against spatially distributed group entities, we can see that the United States has all the types of properties that materialists normally regard as indicative of consciousness.</p>

<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(I’ve added paragraph breaks.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Schwitzgebel asks us to take the perspective of a consciousness entity which is much larger than us humans:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">A planet-sized alien who squints might see the United States as a single, diffuse entity consuming bananas and automobiles, wiring up communication systems, touching the Moon, and regulating its smoggy exhalations – an entity that can be evaluated for the presence or absence of consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">…and the rest of the chapter goes on to show convincingly that, yes, even if the USA isn’t conscious, it’s worthy of being <em>evaluated.</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80"><em>(Do we need Schneider to write the USACT?)</em></p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">This is perilously close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism">panpsychism</a>, <q>the view that the mind or a mindlike aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">We are conscious. My cat is conscious, although differently. Asteroids is conscious; AI is conscious, why not. Mud is conscious; a stellar nebula has its own nebula-like conscious. <em>(Olaf Stapledon, in Star Maker, way back in 1937, wrote beautifully and poignantly about the <a href="/notes/2006/02/scifi/?p=22">culture of gas cloud megatheria</a> at the dawn of the cosmos.)</em></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">What’s the alternative?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe silicon <em>can’t</em> be conscious.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Maybe GPT-4, GPT-5, GPT-N, no matter how convincing, will be an AI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">p-zombie</a>, <q>a hypothetical being that is physically identical to and indistinguishable from a normal person but does not have conscious experience, qualia, or sentience.</q></p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Which implies there’s a cut-off somewhere. And I’m not happy with that either – I’m not ready to declare that my cat isn’t conscious, in her own cat way.</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Everything is conscious.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or nothing is conscious – except me. I’m not so sure about you.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Neither seems satisfying. Or useful?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Back to Eric Schwitzgebel, his paper (and forthcoming book) <em>The Weirdness of the World,</em> and the consciousness or otherwise of the USA…</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Schwitzgebel asked philosopher Daniel Dennett, and he replied:</p>
<blockquote class="bl bw2 pl2 b--orange ml0 italic i">
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">To the extent that the United States is radically unlike human beings, <u>it’s unhelpful to ascribe consciousness to it.</u> Its behavior is impoverished compared to ours and its functional architecture is radically unlike our own. Ascribing consciousness to the United States is not as much straightforwardly false is it is misleading. It invites the reader to too closely assimilate human architecture and group architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">And I like this approach, in a general sense, because it acknowledges the perspective from which we’re asking the question - being human - and therefore implicitly accepts that there will be other perspectives which have different answers.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The question is not: do we have conscious AIs?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">It is more like: from our perspective, is there a non-misleading distinction between non-conscious AI and hypothetical conscious AI, and do we have conscious AIs in that sense?</p>
<hr class="xh1 bg-white w3 ml0 mv5 bb-0 bl-0 br-0 bt-1 b--black" />
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">AND THEN:</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">If an AI <em>were</em> to pass an AI Consciousness Test, in the non-misleading sense above, would it make any difference?</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Udell &amp; Schwitzgebel’s argument is that it’s meaningful in terms of robot rights.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">But chickens have chicken-consciousness and we industrialise their growth and kill and eat them. Maybe the implication is that we ought to feel <a href="/home/2019/06/06/grativore">more gratitude when eating meat</a> - if we eat meat at all - and that it’s poisonous to us to ignore that.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Or maybe they <em>don’t</em> have chicken-consciousness! Arguably we shouldn’t be treating chickens like we do in any case. It’s hard to imagine that we would treat them any worse even if we were certain they were lumps of 100% unthinking rock.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">The point is that it’s not a question we really engage with, as a society. Maybe when it comes up with AI we collectively won’t care then, either.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">So, for me, asking about AI consciousness is a way to winkle out these <em>other</em> questions.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Yes it’s important that we know when, in 50 years or 5 years, the machines wake up and we meet the first conscious AI. But if we then vary in our treatment of that AI, we’ll then have to ask what’s different about chickens, <a href="/home/2023/01/04/interspecies">talking dogs</a>, the Whanganui River in New Zealand which was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200319-the-new-zealand-river-that-became-a-legal-person">granted legal personhood</a> <em>(BBC, 2017),</em> the first uploaded nervous system - the open source <a href="https://openworm.org">OpenWorm virtual nemotode project</a> - the entire USA as a conscious entity, and well, each other.</p>
<p class="measure-wide f6 f5-l lh-copy black-80">Definitely useful questions to ask.</p>
